# ATAC-seq Guided Interpretable Machine Learning Reveals Cancer-Specific Chromatin Features in Cell-free DNA

## Atac-seq指导的可解释机器学习揭示无细胞DNA中的癌症特异性染色质特征

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5485170/latest

Cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs) are DNA fragments found in blood. In healthy individuals, cfDNAs are primarily derived from immune cells, while in cancer patients, a significant fraction of cfDNAs originates from cancerous cells. These cancer-derived cfDNAs contain specific mutations, making cfDNA analysis a promising diagnostic biomarker. Recent studies have revealed that epigenetic information, such as DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning, is retained in cfDNAs, enhancing the accuracy of cell-of-origin predictions. This study aims to characterize the chromatin architecture preserved in cfDNAs by looking at nucleosomal DNA enrichment. Nucleosome fragments from both breast and pancreatic cancer patients are significantly enriched in open chromatin regions. A differential enrichment was observed between healthy donors and cancer patients at cell type-specific ATAC-seq peaks. Leveraging this pattern of open chromatin enrichment, we enhanced the prediction accuracy for identifying breast cancer-derived cfDNA through machine learning. Our analysis pipeline provides an interpretable machine learning platform that effectively detects cancer-specific nucleosome enrichment in cfDNAs.

# Gain neuromodulation mediates perceptual switches: evidence from pupillometry, fMRI, and RNN Modelling

## 增益神经调节介导感知开关: 来自瞳孔测量，fMRI和RNN建模的证据

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2356429/latest

Perceptual updating has been proposed to rely upon evolving activity within a recurrent, distributed thalamocortical network whose interconnections are modulated by bursts of ascending neuromodulatory neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline. To test this hypothesis mechanistically, we leveraged a combination of pupillometry, fMRI and recurrent neural network modelling of an ambiguous figures task. Qualitative shifts in the perceptual interpretation of an ambiguous image were associated with peaks in pupil diameter, an indirect readout of phasic bursts in neuromodulatory tone. We hypothesized that increases in neuromodulatory tone led to neural gain alteration so as to causally mediate perceptual switches. To test this hypothesis, we trained a recurrent neural network to perform an analogous perceptual categorisation task, and then manipulated the gain of the RNN to mimic the effect of neuromodulatory tone. As predicted, we observed an earlier perceptual shift as a function of heightened gain. Leveraging a low-dimensional readout of the RNN dynamics, we developed two novel predictions: perceptual switches should co-occur with peaks in low-dimensional brain state velocity and with flattened energy landscape dynamics. We used dimensionality-reduced summaries of whole-brain fMRI dynamics to independently confirm each of these predictions. These results support the role of the neuromodulatory system in the large-scale network reconfigurations that mediate abrupt changes in perception.

Understanding growth patterns and yield dynamics in potato cultivation is essential for optimizing agricultural practices and improving productivity. This study leverages machine-learning techniques to analyze and predict potato growth stages and yield outcomes based on environmental and physiological data. Various machine-learning models were developed using multispectral imaging, soil parameters, and climatic factors collected across diverse cultivation environments. The models were evaluated for their accuracy in identifying growth stages and forecasting yield performance. Key physiological trends were identified during the tuber initiation, bulking, and maturation phases, correlating with specific environmental conditions. Predictions for tuber yield showed high accuracy, with models achieving R&amp;sup2; values above 0.90 across validation datasets. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of integrating machine learning with precision agriculture systems to enhance decision-making and resource management. The proposed methodology demonstrates significant potential for advancing potato-farming practices by providing actionable insights into growth and yield optimization.

## Mh-yolo: 一种基于YOLOv10n的混合注意力变换器和多尺度扩张注意力的轻量级交通标志检测方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5801614/latest

In intelligent transportation systems, the accurate and real-time detection and recognition of traffic signs are crucial for autonomous and assisted driving. Despite improvements in efficiency and accuracy of existing deep learning object detection algorithms, challenges remain in detecting small objects, handling multi-scale targets, and achieving real-time detection in low computational resource environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight YOLOv10n-based method that incorporates a Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT) to enhance the super-resolution reconstruction of small targets, thereby improving detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-Scale Dilated Attention mechanism (MDA), embedded within the YOLOv10n model to capture multi-scale semantic information through self-attention mechanisms, effectively enhancing the model's detection performance. The proposed method, termed MH-YOLO, significantly improves detection effectiveness while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, to address the lack of nighttime traffic sign data and region-specific sign data in existing datasets, we constructed the Chinese Traffic Sign Dataset (CTSDB), covering all time periods and various complex scenarios. Experimental results show that MH-YOLO achieves detection accuracy comparable to more complex models while maintaining model lightweightness.

# A Dual-Branch Approach with Multi-Stage Semantic Integration and Dual Optical Flow for Micro- Expression Recognition

## 基于多阶段语义融合和双光流的双分支微表情识别方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5801228/latest

Micro-expression can reveal a person's true feelings and possesses significant importance in fields such as police interrogation and psychological counseling. However, due to the subtlety and complexity of micro-expression, comprehensively understanding its features remains a considerable challenge. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a dual-branch network structure that integrates traditional optical flow with deep learning-based optical flow. The micro-expression features are extracted and processed in separate branches, thereby harnessing the complementary advantages of the two optical flow methods. The first branch employs the proposed Multi-Scale Patch Attention Convolution Network (MPACNet), which is designed to process Farneback optical flow by capturing local details. The second branch utilizes the Swin Transformer network with FlowNet2 optical flow, demonstrating outstanding performance in extracting global dynamic information. In addition, this framework effectively combines local information from traditional convolutional networks with both local and global information from the Swin Transformer, achieving multi-level feature fusion. Following the standards of Comprehensive Database Evaluation (CDE) and Single Database Evaluation (SDE), extensive experiments have been conducted on four datasets&amp;mdash;SMIC-HS, CASME II, SAMM, and CAS(ME)3. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches across various evaluation metrics.

## 集成随机建模和神经网络用于梁弹性模量的逆预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5799356/latest

In this work we have obtained elastic modulus from the eigen frequencies of a cantilever beam. The elastic modulus of the beam has random elastic modulus haing exponential covariance function. We have used Monte Carlo simulations with cholesky decomposition to obtain the elastic modulus and eigen frequency data. The data driven non intrusive polynomial chaos is used to obtain eigen elastic modulus from the eigen frequencies. The difference between the elastic modulus data obtained from MCS and NiPCE are used to train a neural network. For new prediction the elastic modulus data from PCE and the difference from neural network are added. The final results shows remarkable resemble with actual data or MCs data. Also the computational time of our proposed method is significantly lower than mcs time as the neural network once trained need smaller time to give the output.

# Research on safe path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles based on an Improved Pied Kingfisher Optimization Algorithm

## 基于改进Pied翠鸟优化算法的无人机安全航迹规划研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5739312/latest

The safety route planning problem in UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)missions is the subject of this paper, which suggests a method based on an improved Pied Kingfisher Optimization algorithm (IPKO) algorithm. By adding collision avoidance restrictions to the swarm scenario, the study expands the single UAVs path planning problem to improve flight safety. In order to reduce the problem of decreased convergence speed in the PKO algorithm, population diversity is increased and premature convergence to the local optimum is prevented by using mirror reflection learning. Furthermore, the algorithm is improved with a crash mechanism model and a fish hawk hunting approach, which allows UAVs to react in real time to environmental changes and avoid hazards. The IPKO algorithm performs better than conventional algorithms in terms of path efficiency and safety, as evidenced by experimental results, which also provide a fresh view of UAV safety path planning.

# The Role of Digitalization on Carbon Emissions: Spatial DDML Test and Neural Networks Prediction

## 数字化对碳排放的作用: 空间DDML测试一下和神经网络预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5755594/latest

Based on the Chinese provincial panel data from 2011 to 2022, this paper innovatively use the spatial double/debiased machine learning (DDML) model, planar and spatial mediating model to study the effect, mediating mechanisms of the digitalization on carbon emissions in both local and surrounding areas. The empirical studies show that digitalization significantly reduces carbon emissions in the local area. Digitalization reduces local carbon emissions by promoting the transformation of energy industrial structure and green technological innovation, reduces carbon emissions in the surrounding regions by promoting the improvement of energy utilization efficiency and green technological progress, improve the industrial intensification in local and surrounding areas thus reducing carbon emissions. Prediction by using the LSTM and neural network shows that for 30 provinces in China except Tibet in 2030, peak carbon dioxide emissions is achievable. For digitally developed regions, or where digitization is lagging behind but developing rapidly, digitization can help these provinces achieve peak carbon dioxide emissions with less emissions. For provinces where digitization is relatively undeveloped, digitization makes little difference in reducing carbon emissions in the process of achieving peak carbon dioxide emissions. For regions where digitization is lagging behind and developing slowly, due to the extensiveness of the industrial model in these provinces, digitization shows a rebound effect, making these regions put more energy demand into the produce, and thus carbon emissions will increase.

## 基于深度Q学习智能的移动网络节能资源分配

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5780317/latest

Mobile networks are in a demanding situation due to various users and requirements as well as optimization of resources to make it energy efficient. As a reaction to these challenges, this research advocates a new method based on DQL, which relies on deep reinforcement learning, for resource allocation in mobile networks. The purpose is to improve energy efficiency and throughput by applying learned intelligence into resource allocation. Achieve this by dynamically, on the basis of learned intelligence, allocating resources to the most important tasks. The proposed framework encompasses several key components: data collection for determining state of the network and user needs, infrastructural setup (including simulation environments), reinforcement learning application (for optimizing resources allocation policies), the model's architecture, training, and evaluation are carefully designed to adapt to dynamic channel conditions and diverse simulation environments. To further enhance the model's performance, additional settings and techniques can be employed The presented optimized techniques subject to DQL are finally capable of showing that the recommended resource allocation framework indeed works. After considerable improvements are experienced to end up with energy efficiency, throughput, fairness index, and capacity compared with the traditional regimes. Implementing intelligent and adaptive resource management techniques in networks represents a significant enhancement to the current state-of-the-art in smart networks, offering a valuable addition to existing capabilities. By leveraging dynamic methods, networks can optimize resource allocation, improve efficiency, and adapt to changing conditions, ultimately leading to enhanced performance, reliability, and user experience The proposed framework can be a good solution for allocating the resources of mobile networks in a way that meets the network&amp;rsquo;s performance needs promptly and steadily, which leads to efficient and sustainable network operations. From the foregoing, this study has far-reaching implications for the future of mobile communication networks, as it demonstrates the potential of deep reinforcement learning methods to revolutionize resource allocation optimization. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, network operators can unlock significant improvements in efficiency, performance, and user experience, ultimately paving the way for more robust, adaptive, and intelligent mobile networks that can meet the evolving demands of a connected world.

# Gut microbiota in young adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and its performance as diagnostic biomarkers

## 年轻成人高功能自闭症谱系障碍的肠道菌群及其作为诊断生物标志物的表现

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5753373/latest

Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) starts in the early developmental period, symptoms may not become fully apparent until adulthood in patients with high-functioning ASD. Diagnosing ASD in adults presents unique challenges and there are currently no specific biomarkers for this condition. Most existing studies on gut microbiota in ASD are conducted in children; however, the composition of the gut microbiota in children differs significantly from that of adults. This study aimed to study young adults with high-functioning ASD on their gut microbiota. Using metagenomic sequencing, we evaluated the gut microbiota in 45 adults with high-functioning ASD and 45 matched healthy controls. Adjusting for sociodemographic information, dietary habits, and clinical data, we observed a distinct microbiota profile between adults with ASD and controls, with their autistic symptom severity strongly correlating to microbial diversity (correlation coefficient = -0.351, p-value &amp;lt;0.001). Despite a similar dietary pattern, the ASD group exhibited more gastrointestinal symptoms than the healthy controls. An internally validated machine-learning predictive model that combines the Autism Spectrum Quotient questionnaire score and microbial features could achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.955 in diagnosing ASD in adults. This study evaluates the gut microbiota in adult ASD and highlights its potential as a non-invasive biomarker to enhance diagnosis of ASD in this population group.

# Identification of pancreatic nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors and solid pseudopapillary tumors via the construction of a consensus clustering model based on enhanced CT images

## 通过基于增强CT图像的共识聚类模型的构建识别胰腺无功能神经内分泌肿瘤和实性假乳头状肿瘤

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5782491/latest

Background: Unsupervised clustering has played a greater role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors in recent years. This study aimed to investigate the value of constructing a c[1]lustering model for unsupervised learning based on enhanced CT to identify pancreatic nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors (NF-pNETs) and solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPTs).
Methods: 45 patients with SPTs and 47 patients with NF-psNETs were retrospectively analyzed. The data were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3. One-way logistic regression was performed for each clinical variable to assess its relationship with the clustered labels, and a logistic regression model was fitted with the clustered labels as the dependent variable and the clinical variables as independent variables. Variables with P values &amp;lt;0.1 were selected for further analysis. Multifactorial logistic regression models were fitted via the clinical variables selected in the univariate analysis, ridge regularization (L2 penalty) was used to prevent overfitting and address potential multicollinearity, with the strength of regularization (alpha) set to a default value of 1. Clinical variables that were meaningful in the multifactorial logistic regression analyses were used to construct the final logistic regression model, which was used to predict individual clinical-based group labeling on the basis of individual clinical characteristics. For imaging, the optimal number of clusters k selected by the covariance coefficient was used to build the clustering model via unsupervised classification of the lesions through consensus clustering analysis fusing the imaging histological features of arterial-phase, venous-phase, and delayed-phase images. The clinical factors with a final p value &amp;lt; 0.2 were subsequently combined with the clustering model to perform stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses, thereby establishing a joint model. The performance of the three models was assessed via AUC values, and column line plots were generated to visualize the models. Finally, the clinical validity of the models was assessed via decision curve analysis (DCA).
Results:&amp;nbsp; The AUCs of the clustered and clinical models were 0.70 and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66&ndash;0.81) in the training set and 0.65 and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64&ndash;0.87) in the validation set, and the AUCs of the training and test sets in the joint model were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81&ndash;0.94) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.71&ndash;0.96), respectively. Decision curve analysis revealed that the joint clinical-clustering model had a greater net benefit when the high-risk threshold probability was in the range of 0--1.
Conclusions: Unsupervised clustering models based on enhanced CT have potential for discriminating between SPTs and NF-PNETs, which can inform clinical decision-making.

# A Grounded Theory Investigation into the Otolaryngology Resident Learning Experience

## 耳鼻咽喉科住院医师学习体验的扎根理论调查

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5760451/latest

Background
Otolaryngologic residency operative education is a unique process that teaches technical and reasoning skills during high-stakes situations. However, there is no consensus on what qualities of a teacher or environment create a positive surgical learning experience. This study aims to use qualitative assessment to identify key elements of effective otolaryngologic residency education.
Methods
Purposive sampling was used to select a heterogeneous cohort from our institution&rsquo;s Otolaryngology department between March and December 2023. Interviewees were categorized as either &ldquo;Learners&rdquo; (residents) or &ldquo;Teachers&rdquo; (attending) and either &ldquo;Junior&rdquo; or &ldquo;Senior.&rdquo; A trained interviewer conducted semi-structured interviews until thematic saturation was reached. Constant comparative analysis using coding, memoing, and categorization was conducted using grounded theory methodology.
Results
Twenty-one participants completed interviews, averaging 42 minutes. A total of 87 codes and 15 concepts were extracted from the data. Advanced coding and theoretical integration revealed four themes that are essential to the creation of a positive teaching experience: &ldquo;Investment in Learner/Education,&rdquo; &ldquo;Communication,&rdquo; &ldquo;Discerning Learner Capacity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Creation of Learning Environment.&rdquo; &ldquo;Investment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Discerning Capacity&rdquo; represent the ability and desire of the teacher to assess and advance learner progress during surgery. &ldquo;Communication&rdquo; refers to the ability to convey information clearly and succinctly. &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; reflects the ability of the teacher/surgeon to navigate the complex operative environment to create a safe and effective learning experience within the context of a surgical operation.
Conclusions
This study suggests that positive operative learning experiences rely on four thematic elements. A teacher's conscious attention to these elements and feedback from learners targeting them may assist in creating a more effective surgical learning environment. Further research is needed to understand the nuance of learner and teacher experience and how best to optimize and operationalize these concepts in diverse surgical educational settings.

# Integrated photonic 3D tensor processing engine

## 集成光子3D张量处理引擎

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5399911/latest

Optical computing leverages high bandwidth, low latency, and power efficiency, which is considered as one of the most effective solutions for accelerating deep learning tasks. However, mainstream photonic hardware accelerators are primarily optimized for two-dimensional (2D) matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs). To implement three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), high-order tensors must be reshaped, duplicated, and cached in the electrical domain according to the size of the accelerators before computation, leading to extra memory usage and time overheads. Additionally, synchronization across multiple channels depends on external electronic clocks, which increases the complexity of the system. In this work, we propose an integrated photonic 3D tensor processing engine (3D-TPE) based on the interweaving of time, wavelength, and space. Data caching, computation, and synchronization are realized in the optical domain, reducing memory and time usage, and simplifying the system. Optical caching and synchronization are achieved with an optical tunable delay line chip supporting versatile clock frequencies up to 200 GHz, and optical computing is accomplished with a dual-coupled micro-ring resonators (MRRs) based crossbar chip with a 3-dB passband width of 50 GHz. We verify the processing capabilities of the 3D-TPE at clock frequencies ranging from 10 GHz to 30 GHz and perform a proof-of-concept experiment for a LiDAR 3D point cloud image recognition task operating at 20 GHz, achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.06%. The proposed 3D-TPE is anticipated to facilitate high-order tensor convolutions, playing an important role in autonomous driving, healthcare, video analytics, virtual reality, etc.

# Using Cumulative summation analysis (CUSUM) for the learning curve of robotic docking time in radical prostatectomy with the HUGO RAS System

## 使用HUGO RAS系统对根治性前列腺切除术中机器人对接时间的学习曲线进行累积求和分析 (cu sum)

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5782260/latest

Minimally invasive surgery like robotic surgery is known to yield better outcomes in terms of blood loss, blood transfusion, and length of stay, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy provides a clear example compared to open surgery. It is still constrained by issues related to platform availability and cost-effectiveness. Introducing new robotic platforms, such as the HUGO&amp;trade; Robot-Assisted Surgery (RAS) System, could lead to longer operating times caused by the surgeon's learning curve, system configuration, adjustment of robotic devices, and robotic docking. Several studies have assessed the influence of resident physicians on outcomes in urological surgeries. Our main objective was to evaluate the learning curve of the docking time for 195 radical prostatectomies performed in our hospital. The results of our research indicate that the setup and docking process with the HUGO RAS system can be accomplished with ease, and the learning curve for robotic docking is consistent with the available data for other robotic platforms. Our training facilitated a rapid docking process and seamless completion of the surgery.

# Accuracy and Reliability of 3D Cephalometric Landmark Detection with Deep Learning

## 基于深度学习的三维头影测量界标检测准确性和可靠性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5777684/latest

Objective: Three-dimensional (3D) landmark detection is essential for assessing craniofacial growth and planning surgeries such as orthodontic, orthognathic, traumatic, and plastic procedures. This study aimed to develop an automatic 3D landmarking model for oral and maxillofacial regions and to validate its accuracy, robustness, and generalizability in both spiral computed tomography (SCT, 41 landmarks) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT, 14 landmarks) scans.
Methods: The model was constructed using an optimized lightweight 3D U-Net network architecture. Its accuracy, robustness, and generalizability were thoroughly evaluated and validated through a multicenter retrospective diagnostic study. The internal dataset included 480 SCT and 240 CBCT cases. For external validation, 320 SCT and 150 CBCT cases were assessed using mean radial error (MRE) and success detection rate within 2-, 3-, and 4-mm error thresholds as the primary evaluation metrics. Error analyses for landmark detection along each coordinate axis were performed. Consistency tests among index observers were conducted.
Results: The average MRE for both SCT and CBCT was consistently below 1.3 mm and, notably, below 1.4 mm in complex conditions such as malocclusion, missing dental landmarks, and the presence of metal artifacts. No significant differences in MRE and SDR at 2-4 mm were observed between external and internal SCT and CBCT sets. SCT bone landmarks were more precise than dental ones, with no difference between bone/soft tissue and dental/soft tissue. CBCT dental landmarks exhibited greater precision compared to bone landmarks. A detailed error analysis across the coordinate axes showed that the coronal axis had the highest error rates. The implementation of this model significantly improved the landmarking proficiency of senior and junior specialists by 15.9% and 28.9%, respectively, while also accelerating the process by a factor of 6 to 9.5 times.
Conclusions: This study shows that the AI-driven model delivers high-precision 3D localization of oral and maxillofacial structures, even in complex scenarios. The model can aid specialists across all experience levels in conducting accurate and efficient localization analyses, owing to its strong clinical utility, robustness, and generalizability.
Clinical Relevance: 3D cephalometric landmark detection is crucial for assessing craniofacial growth and planning diverse surgical procedures, such as orthodontic, orthognathic, trauma, and aesthetic interventions. The traditional manual landmark identification is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This proposed AI method provides accurate measurements for both soft and hard tissues, streamlines digital planning, decreases reliance on expert knowledge, and enhances the efficiency and success of treatments.

# A learning-driven algorithm for maintenance team and UAV collaboration in restoring power network

## 一种学习驱动的电力网络维修团队与无人机协同恢复算法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5708499/latest

Power networks are highly vulnerable to disruptions caused by natural and man-made disasters, necessitating prompt restoration of damaged power supply. This research addresses the challenge of efficiently restoring large-scale power networks, which often involve numerous unknown or uninspected faulty nodes. Leveraging advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology, this study facilitates the inspection of these nodes and subsequent manual maintenance. However, coordinating maintenance teams and UAVs is complex due to the intricate network structure and scheduling correlations. We propose a learning-driven (LD) algorithm to enhance human-UAV collaboration for effective power network restoration. The algorithm includes an initialization method to generate promising initial solutions, followed by the use of search operators as basic action elements and a learning engine to guide search directions based on state assessments. Comprehensive experiments validate the algorithm&rsquo;s effectiveness in improving the restoration process.

# Spatio-temporal analysis of wetland loss in the lower Mekong River Basin based on surface water detection datasets and machine learning

## 基于地表水检测数据和机器学习的湄公河下游湿地流失时空分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4781968/latest

Wetland loss and degradation is a major global issue in which its detailed estimation of spatio-temporal distribution will be a key for understanding the dynamics and subsequent impact assessment studies. This study aimed to estimate the spatio-temporal distributions of wetland loss, analyze its geographical characteristics, and quantify the likelihood of loss occurrence for existing wetlands in the lower Mekong River Basin in Cambodia. Using the global surface water detection datasets, the spatiotemporal distribution of wetland loss with high resolution (30m) over the entire study area (140km&amp;times;210km) during 1984&amp;ndash;2021 was estimated. Statistically significant differences were found in the distance from urban areas and distance from river channels for the existing wetlands and lost wetlands as of 2021, in which the lost wetlands tend to locate closer to urban areas. Subsequent Land Use/Land Cover after the wetland loss was found to be mainly croplands (72.2%) in the study area. Though our estimate overall agrees with the recent global-scale estimate, our estimate resulted in notable ratio of rangelands (11.3%), which represents the unique characteristics of floodplain wetlands in the lower Mekong River Basin. The Random Forest and Light GBM algorithms-based wetland loss prediction models resulted in good statistical evaluation metrics. In both models, the distance from river channels was found to be the most important feature for classifying existing wetlands and lost wetlands. Application of the developed models successfully provided the map of likelihood of wetland loss for existing wetlands in the study area.

In order to improve the overall performance of edge-integrated edge IoT networks, this research introduces a combined technique based on profound learning for booking assets. If an IoT network wants to finish a task quickly and effectively, it has to get the greatest resources from the edge layer. Thorough asset booking is crucial to the identification and transfer of optimal assets. The integration of edge networks with IoT applications and the reduction of data transmission latency were previously addressed using profound learning algorithms. If we want to make an Internet of Things application more feasible and provide better service overall, we should think about other metrics like reaction time, waiting time, and bandwidth needs. Combining a convolutional neural network with a gated repeating unit in a certain manner achieves this enhanced performance. The suggested asset booking model considers the features and requirements of the assets in order to select the most suitable ones from the pool and allocate them to the IoT networks. Here, we give a comprehensive analysis of the method-data combination.

# Brain-Guided Convolutional Neural Networks Reveal Task-Specific Representations in Scene Processing

## 脑引导卷积神经网络揭示场景处理中特定于任务的表征

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5753306/latest

Scene categorization is the dominant proxy for visual understanding, yet humans can perform a large number of visual tasks within any scene. Consequently, we know little about how different tasks change how the is scene processed, represented, and its features ultimately used.&nbsp; Here, we developed a novel brain-guided convolutional neural network (CNN) where each convolutional layer was separately guided by neural responses taken at different time points while observers performed two different tasks on the same set of images.&nbsp; We then reconstructed each layer&rsquo;s activation maps via deconvolution to spatially assess how different features were used as a function of task.&nbsp; The brain-guided CNN made use of image features that human observers identified as being crucial to complete each task starting around 244 ms and persisted to 402 ms. Critically, because the same images were used across the two tasks, the CNN could only succeed if the neural data captured task-relevant differences.&nbsp; Our analyses of the activation maps across layers revealed that the brain&rsquo;s spatiotemporal representation of local image features evolves systematically over time. This underscores how distinct image features emerge at different stages of processing, shaped by the observer&rsquo;s goals and behavioral context.

# Establishing a Periodic SM Profile Model Based on Fourier Analysis using Hydrologic Soil Groups

## 利用水文土壤组建立基于傅里叶分析的周期性SM剖面模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5771651/latest

Accurately predicting global soil moisture (SM) is crucial for sustainable agriculture and water resource management. Recognizing the challenges posed by the heterogeneity of SM's spatiotemporal variability, this study proposes a novel approach that leverages Fourier analysis to decompose the periodic fluctuations in SM, revealing underlying trends and cycles. This approach is integrated with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the accuracy of global SM prediction. Fourier analysis transforms time series data of SM into frequencies and amplitudes, capturing its intrinsic periodic characteristics. This transformation reveals both variable and invariant features representing changes within and between periods. By fusing these periodic features within the cycle. By integrating these periodic features with sequence data and leveraging the memory and sequence learning capabilities of LSTM neural networks, the accuracy and reliability of global SM prediction can be enhanced. Our experiments on the LandBench1.0 dataset demonstrate that the proposed model reduces the root mean square error by 0.4% to 1.1% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. This study underscores that the LSTM with periodic features of SM can adapt to the inherent complex spatial-temporal patterns in SM dynamics, especially in scenarios characterized by rapid environmental changes and subtle temporal dynamics.

## Anston: 一种用于结构化数据分类的注意力机制网络模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5766278/latest

To reduce the pressure on public health services caused by the aging population, nursing homes need to predict disease risks for the elderly periodically. To improve the disease risks predicting ability of nursing homes, we designed Anston (An Attention Mechanism Network Model for Structured Data Classification) in the application scenario of innovative elderly care. The Anston model can use the physiological indicators and pathogenic factors easily collected by nursing homes to predict disease risks. In the study of disease risk prediction based on physiological indicators and pathogenic factors for thoughtful elderly care, we designed a data enhancement method, a feature weight automatic update method, and a multi-layer perceptron neural network to solve the problems of sample shortage, inconsistent feature weights, and sample imbalance. At the same time, we designed an attention mechanism network model for structured data classification based on the multi-layer perceptron neural network developed in this paper. To fit the application scenario of competent elderly care, we propose a disease risk prediction model, Anston, based on the data enhancement method, feature automatic update method, and structured data classification attention mechanism network designed in this paper. We use public data sets and subject data as sample data in the experiment. The experimental results show that the Anston model has an accuracy of 95%, a precision of 92%, a recall of 91%, a specificity of 93%, an F1 score of 91%, and an AUC of 93% in predicting disease risks in the experiment, which have achieved the SOTA result.

# Transfer Learning on Protein Language Models Improves Antimicrobial Peptide Classification

## 蛋白质语言模型上的迁移学习改善了抗菌肽分类

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are essential components of the innate immune system in humans and other organisms, exhibiting potent activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens. Their potential therapeutic applications, particularly in combating antibiotic resistance, have rendered AMP classification a vital task in computational biology. However, the scarcity of labeled AMP sequences, coupled with the diversity and complexity of AMPs, poses significant challenges for the training of standalone AMP classifiers. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm in addressing such challenges across various fields, leading to the development of Protein Language Models (PLMs). These models leverage vast amounts of unlabeled protein sequences to learn biologically relevant features, providing transferable protein sequence representations (embeddings), that can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks even with limited labeled data. This study evaluates the performance of several publicly-available PLMs in AMP classification utilizing transfer learning techniques and benchmarking them against state-of-the-art neural-based classifiers. Our key findings include: (a) Model scale is crucial, with classification performance consistently improving with increasing model size; (b) State-of-the-art results are achieved with minimal effort utilizing PLM embedding representations alongside shallow classifiers; and (c) Classification performance is further enhanced through efficient fine-tuning of PLMs&rsquo; parameters. Code showcasing our pipelines is available at https://github.com/EliasGeorg/PLM_AMP_Classification.

# Computational and Machine Learning Approaches for Optimizing Anti-CD3&epsilon; Nanobody: Humanization and Characterization for Enhanced Therapeutic Efficacy

## 优化Anti-CD3和 ε 的计算和机器学习方法; 纳米抗体: 增强治疗效果的人源化和表征

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5769566/latest

This study presents a comprehensive machine-learning-driven approach for the in silico humanization and characterization of anti-CD3&epsilon; nanobodies. Nanobodies, single-domain antibodies derived from camelids, hold immense therapeutic potential due to their small size, high solubility, and exceptional stability. However, their camelid origin necessitates humanization to minimize immunogenicity in therapeutic applications. Using state-of-the-art computational tools such as NanoNet, RoseTTAFold, and PyDock, we modeled and analyzed both wild type and humanized anti-CD3&epsilon; nanobody variants. Key metrics, including structural stability, binding efficiency, thermal stability, and aggregation propensity, were evaluated. Humanization achieved enhanced humanness scores, increased thermal stability, and retained strong binding interactions with CD3&epsilon; while preserving the nanobody&amp;rsquo;s structural integrity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed minimal deviations in structural flexibility and binding-site compatibility post-humanization. These findings support the efficacy of computational methods in optimizing nanobody therapeutics for clinical applications, paving the way for advanced immunotherapy strategies targeting immune-related disorders. The results demonstrate that the humanized anti-CD3&epsilon; nanobody exhibits enhanced thermal stability, reduced aggregation propensity, improved humanness scores, and comparable binding efficiency to the wild type nanobody, making it a promising therapeutic candidate.

# An X-linked long non-coding RNA, PTCHD1-AS, regulates autistic behaviors in humans and in mice

## PTCHD1-AS，X-连接的长链非编码RNA调节人类和小鼠的自闭症行为

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5619348/latest

There are ~100 genes or copy number variants (CNVs) used in genetic testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD, or autism). These genes are protein-coding, and the associated phenotypes often extend beyond socio-behavioral traits seen in autism including cognitive/medical complexities, epilepsy, and ADHD. Here, we characterize 27 males with ASD through whole genome sequencing (WGS), delineating X-chromosome microdeletions that implicate the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PTCHD1-AS as an ASD-susceptibility gene (OR=2.56, p=0.01). Two Ptchd1-as knockout (KO) murine models, created by removing the evolutionarily conserved exon-3, show ASD-like features in males, increasing repetitive behaviors and impairing typical social behavior and communication without overt cognitive comorbidities or ADHD-like behaviors. Hippocampus-dependent synaptic function, complex learning, and locomotor activity are unaffected in KO mice. Native nuclear-enriched mouse Ptchd1-as showed sustained expression from post-natal day-7 onward in the dorsal striatum, a predominantly GABAergic brain region implicated in ASD. Multi-omics revealed transcriptomic alterations in striatal oligodendrocyte, astrocyte and neurons impacting myelination and plasticity pathways. Disrupting Ptchd1-as led to reductions in conventional Protein Kinase-C, altered Src and GSK3&alpha;/&beta; phosphorylation, and an enhancement of synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation and long-term depression). Together, these findings implicate striatal molecular and circuit level dysregulation via Ptchd1-as in ASD etiology.

# Volcano Monitoring System for Long-Term Eruption Forecasting Using Multiple Data Sources

## 使用多数据源进行长期喷发预报的火山监测系统

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5787009/latest

Accurately forecasting volcanic eruptions is challenging due to the complexity of precursory signals. Here, we develop a machine learning-based long-term eruption forecasting model for Mount Aso, Japan, by integrating multiple observational datasets&mdash;seismic tremors, magnetic field, crater wall temperature, thermal pool temperature and volume, tilt, and volcanic gas amount&mdash;at the characteristic temporal scales of the underlying physical phenomena. The temporal scales are aligned with the intrinsic dynamics captured by each dataset to enhance the model's predictive capability. We construct a theoretical framework to quantify the predictive performance improvement. Our proposed model significantly improves predictive performance, increasing the Matthews correlation coefficient by 0.65 compared to the conventional seismic-tremor-based model, and achieving a precision of &gt;70% in predicting volcanic eruptions. Our findings demonstrate that an ensemble of multiple data sources over optimized temporal scales, underpinned by a theoretical ensemble framework, enables high-precision, interpretable eruption forecasts months in advance and makes effective disaster mitigation planning possible.

# A Fault Diagnosis Method for Analog Circuits Based on VMD-CFOA-ELM

## 基于vmd-cfoa-elm的模拟电路故障诊断方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5769828/latest

Fault feature extraction of analog circuits is the main factor affecting their fault diagnosis accuracy. Therefore, in order to increase the accuracy of analog circuit fault diagnosis, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method for analog circuit based on VMD-CFOA-ELM and DGCCA(Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis,DGCCA). The method firstly performs VMD(Variational Mode Decomposition,VMD) on the fault time-domain response signal to obtain all the IMF (Intrinsic Mode Function,IMF) components and calculates the CMSE(Composite Multi-Scale Entropy,CMSE) of each IMF component, treating this as a separate subset of fault features. Next, it extracts the time-frequency domain characteristic features of the fault response signal and uses the DGCCA algorithm for supervised feature fusion extraction, constructing a shared representation feature matrix G, which is spliced with the subset of fault features as the input features of the classifier. Finally, the CFOA(Catch Fish Optimization Algorithm, CFOA)algorithm is relied upon to optimize the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine,ELM) classifier to have good classification accuracy to diagnose the type of faults in the test circuits. Fault simulation diagnostics on a Sallen-Key bandpass filter circuit show that, compared to methods such as KPCA-ELM, KSLPP-ELM, EEMD multi-scale entropy-LSSVM, and WP-ICA energy spectrum-SVM, the proposed method achieves the highest accuracy, reaching 99.20%. Additionally, this method is portable and applicable to fault diagnosis of other analog circuits.
