# Many-body expansion based machine learning models for octahedral transition metal complexes

## 基于多体展开的八面体过渡金属配合物机器学习模型

Graph-based machine learning (ML) models for material properties show great potential to accelerate virtual high-throughput screening of large chemical spaces. However, in their simplest forms, graph-based models do not include any 3D information and are unable to distinguish stereoisomers such as those arising from different orderings of ligands around a metal center in coordination complexes. In this work we present a modification to revised autocorrelation descriptors, a molecular graph featurization method, for predicting spin state dependent properties of octahedral transition metal complexes (TMCs). Inspired by analytical semi-empirical models for TMCs, the new modeling strategy is based on the many-body expansion (MBE) and allows one to tune the captured stereoisomer information by changing the truncation order of the MBE. We present the necessary modifications to include this approach in two commonly used ML methods, kernel ridge regression and feed-forward neural networks. On a test set composed of all possible isomers of binary TMCs, the best MBE models achieve mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.75 kcal mol−1 on spin-splitting energies and 0.26 eV on frontier orbital energy gaps, a 30%–40% reduction in error compared to models based on our previous approach. We also observe improved generalization to previously unseen ligands where the best-performing models exhibit MAEs of 4.00 kcal mol−1 (i.e. a 0.73 kcal mol−1 reduction) on the spin-splitting energies and 0.53 eV (i.e. a 0.10 eV reduction) on the frontier orbital energy gaps. Because the new approach incorporates insights from electronic structure theory, such as ligand additivity relationships, these models exhibit systematic generalization from homoleptic to heteroleptic complexes, allowing for efficient screening of TMC search spaces.

# Neuromorphic, physics-informed spiking neural network for molecular dynamics

## 用于分子动力学的神经形态，物理信息脉冲神经网络

**Authors:** Vuong Van Pham, Temoor Muther and Amirmasoud Kalantari Dahaghi

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used across many fields from chemical science to engineering. In recent years, Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) in MD attracted significant attention and has become a new direction of scientific research. However, effectively integrating Sci-ML with MD simulations remains challenging. Compliance with the physical principles, comparable performance to a numerical method, and integration of start-of-the-art ML architectures are top-concerned examples of those gaps. This work addresses these challenges by introducing, for the first time, the neuromorphic physics-informed spiking neural network (NP-SNN) architecture to solve Newton’s equations of motion for MD systems. Unlike conventional Sci-ML methods that heavily rely on prior training data, NP-SNN performs without needing pre-existing data by embedding MD fundamentals directly into its learning process. It also leverages the enhanced representation of real biological neural systems through spiking neural network integration with molecular dynamic physical principles, offering greater efficiency compared to conventional AI algorithms. NP-SNN integrates three core components: (1) embedding MD principles directly into the training, (2) employing best practices for training physics-informed ML systems, and (3) utilizing a highly advanced and efficient SNN architecture. By integrating these core components, this proposed architecture proves its efficacy through testing across various molecular dynamics systems. In contrast to traditional MD numerical methods, NP-SNN is trained and deployed within a continuous time framework, effectively mitigating common issues related to time step stability. The results indicate that NP-SNN provides a robust Sci-ML framework that can make accurate predictions across diverse scientific molecular applications. This architecture accelerates and enhances molecular simulations, facilitating deeper insights into interactions and system dynamics at the molecular level. The proposed NP-SNN paves the way for foundational advancements across various domains of chemical and material sciences especially in energy, environment, and sustainability fields.

# Machine and deep learning performance in out-of-distribution regressions

## 分布外回归中的机器和深度学习性能

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ada221

**Authors:** Assaf Shmuel, Oren Glickman and Teddy Lazebnik

Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are gaining popularity due to their effectiveness in many computational tasks. These models are based on an intuitive, but frequently unsatisfied, assumption that the data used to train these models is well-representing the task at hand. This gives rise to the out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge which can cause an unexpected drop in the data-driven model’s performance. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various ML and DL models in in-distribution (ID) versus OOD prediction. While the degradation in OOD performance is well acknowledged, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to quantify it for various models on a large benchmark n = 15 real-world regression datasets. We extensively ( runs) compare the ID versus OOD performance of XGBoost, random forest, K-nearest-neighbors, support vector machine, and linear regression models, as well as AutoML models (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool and AutoKeras). In addition, to tackle this challenge, we propose to integrate a symbolic regression (SR) as a feature engineering method model with an ML or DL model to improve its performance for OOD samples. Our results show that the incorporation of SR-derived features significantly enhances the predictive capabilities of both ML and DL models with 3.70% and 10.20%, on average, of the OOD samples, respectively, without reducing ID performance and in fact improving it to a slightly lower extent. As such, this method can help produce more generalized and robust data-driven models.

# Evaluating machine learning models for supernova gravitational wave signal classification

We investigate the potential of using gravitational wave (GW) signals from rotating core-collapse supernovae to probe the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. By generating GW signals from simulations with various EOSs, we train machine learning models to classify them and evaluate their performance. Our study builds on previous work by examining how different machine learning models, parameters, and data preprocessing techniques impact classification accuracy. We test convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as six classical algorithms: random forest, support vector machines, naïve Bayes(NB), logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and eXtreme gradient boosting. All models, except NB, achieve over 90 per cent accuracy on our dataset. Additionally, we assess the impact of approximating the GW signal using the general relativistic effective potential (GREP) on EOS classification. We find that models trained on GREP data exhibit low classification accuracy. However, normalizing time by the peak signal frequency, which partially compensates for the absence of the time dilation effect in GREP, leads to a notable improvement in accuracy. Despite this, the accuracy does not exceed 70 per cent, suggesting that GREP lacks the precision necessary for EOS classification. Finally, our study has several limitations, including the omission of detector noise and the focus on a single progenitor mass model, which will be addressed in future works.

Abstract: Accurately calculating energies and atomic forces with linear-scaling methods is a crucial approach to accelerating and improving molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we introduce HamGNN-DM, a machine learning model designed to predict atomic forces and energies using local density matrices in molecular dynamics simulations. This approach achieves efficient predictions with a time complexity of O(n), making it highly suitable for large-scale systems. Experiments in different systems demonstrate that HamGNN-DM achieves DFT-level precision in predicting the atomic forces in different system sizes, which is vital for the molecular dynamics. Furthermore, this method provides valuable electronic structure information throughout the dynamics and exhibits robust performance.

Abstract: Here, we present the outcomes from the second Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, which engaged participants across global hybrid locations, resulting in 34 team submissions. The submissions spanned seven key application areas and demonstrated the diverse utility of LLMs for applications in (1) molecular and material property prediction; (2) molecular and material design; (3) automation and novel interfaces; (4) scientific communication and education; (5) research data management and automation; (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation; and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from scientific literature. Each team submission is presented in a summary table with links to the code and as brief papers in the appendix. Beyond team results, we discuss the hackathon event and its hybrid format, which included physical hubs in Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, Berlin, Lausanne, and Tokyo, alongside a global online hub to enable local and virtual collaboration. Overall, the event highlighted significant improvements in LLM capabilities since the previous year's hackathon, suggesting continued expansion of LLMs for applications in materials science and chemistry research. These outcomes demonstrate the dual utility of LLMs as both multipurpose models for diverse machine learning tasks and platforms for rapid prototyping custom applications in scientific research.

Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field that promises to revolutionize various domains, such as simulation optimization, data processing, and more, by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. This paper outlines innovative pedagogical strategies developed by university lecturers in Finland and Spain for teaching quantum computer programming and quantum software engineering. Our curriculum integrates essential tools and methodologies such as containerization with Docker, Qiskit, PennyLane, and Ocean SDK to provide a comprehensive learning experience. The approach consists of several steps, from introducing the fundamentals of quantum mechanics to hands-on labs focusing on practical use cases. We believe quantum computer programming is an important topic and one that is hard to teach, so having a teaching agenda and guidelines for teaching can be of great help.

# Sparse identification of evolution equations via Bayesian model selection

## 基于贝叶斯模型选择的演化方程稀疏辨识

**Authors:** Tim W. Kroll, Oliver Kamps

arXiv:2501.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative formulation of evolution equations is the backbone for prediction, control, and understanding of dynamical systems across diverse scientific fields. Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships.

# Garbage in Garbage out: Impacts of data quality on criminal network intervention

## 垃圾中的垃圾: 数据质量对犯罪网络干预的影响

**Authors:** Wang Ngai Yeung, Riccardo Di Clemente, Renaud Lambiotte

arXiv:2501.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criminal networks such as human trafficking rings are threats to the rule of law, democracy and public safety in our global society. Network science provides invaluable tools to identify key players and design interventions for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), e.g., to dismantle their organisation. However, poor data quality and the adaptiveness of criminal networks through self-organization make effective disruption extremely challenging. Although there exists a large body of work building and applying network scientific tools to attack criminal networks, these work often implicitly assume that the network measurements are accurate and complete. Moreover, there is thus far no comprehensive understanding of the impacts of data quality on the downstream effectiveness of interventions. This work investigates the relationship between data quality and intervention effectiveness based on classical graph theoretic and machine learning-based approaches. Decentralization emerges as a major factor in network robustness, particularly under conditions of incomplete data, which renders attack strategies largely ineffective. Moreover, the robustness of centralized networks can be boosted using simple heuristics, making targeted attack more infeasible. Consequently, we advocate for a more cautious application of network science in disrupting criminal networks, the continuous development of an interoperable intelligence ecosystem, and the creation of novel network inference techniques to address data quality challenges.

# Reinforcement-learning-based control of turbulent channel flows at high Reynolds numbers

## 基于强化学习的高雷诺数下湍流通道流控制

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01573

**Authors:** Zisong Zhou, Mengqi Zhang, Xiaojue Zhu

arXiv:2501.01573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed to develop control strategies for drag reduction in direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flows at high Reynolds numbers. The DRL agent uses near-wall streamwise velocity fluctuations as input to modulate wall blowing and suction velocities. These DRL-based strategies achieve significant drag reduction, with maximum rates of 35.6% at Re_{\tau}=180, 30.4% at Re_{\tau}=550, and 27.7% at Re_{\tau}=1000, outperforming traditional opposition control methods. Expanded range of wall actions further enhances drag reduction, although effectiveness decreases at higher Reynolds numbers. The DRL models elevate the virtual wall through blowing and suction, aiding in drag reduction. However, at higher Reynolds numbers, the amplitude modulation of large-scale structures significantly increases the residual Reynolds stress on the virtual wall, diminishing the drag reduction. Analysis of budget equations provides a systematic understanding of the drag reduction dynamics behind. DRL models reduce skin friction by inhibiting the redistribution of wall-normal turbulent kinetic energy. This further suppresses the wall-normal velocity fluctuations, reducing the production of Reynolds stress, thereby decreasing skin friction. This study showcases the successful application of DRL in turbulence control at high Reynolds numbers and elucidates the nonlinear control mechanisms underlying the observed drag reduction.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into chemistry offers transformative potential in the design of molecules. However, the focus has often been on creating highly efficient predictive models, sometimes at the expense of interpretability. We leverage explainable AI techniques to explore the design of boron-based Lewis acids, which play a pivotal role in organic reactions. Using Fluoride Ion Affinity as a proxy for Lewis acidity, we developed interpretable ML models based on chemically meaningful descriptors, including ab initio features and substituent-based parameters. By constraining the chemical space to well-defined molecular scaffolds, we achieved highly accurate predictions, surpassing conventional black-box deep learning models in low-data regime. Interpretability analyses of the models unraveled the origin of Lewis acidity in these compounds and identified actionable levers to modulate it. This work bridges ML and chemist's way of thinking, demonstrating how explainable models can inspire molecular design and enhance scientific understanding of chemical reactivity.

arXiv:2501.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial in drug discovery, particularly during hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases, however, limitations in ligand force fields continue to impact prediction accuracy. In this work, we validate relative binding free energy (RBFE) accuracy using neural network potentials (NNPs) for the ligands. We utilize a novel NNP model, AceForce 1.0, based on the TensorNet architecture for small molecules that broadens the applicability to diverse drug-like compounds, including all important chemical elements and supporting charged molecules. Using established benchmarks, we show overall improved accuracy and correlation in binding affinity predictions compared with GAFF2 for molecular mechanics and ANI2-x for NNPs. Slightly less accuracy but comparable correlations with OPLS4. We also show that we can run the NNP simulations at 2 fs timestep, at least two times larger than previous NNP models, providing significant speed gains. The results show promise for further evolutions of free energy calculations using NNPs while demonstrating its practical use already with the current generation. The code and NNP model are publicly available for research use.

Abstract: Rapid yet accurate simulations of fluid dynamics around complex geometries is critical in a variety of engineering and scientific applications, including aerodynamics and biomedical flows. However, while scientific machine learning (SciML) has shown promise, most studies are constrained to simple geometries, leaving complex, real-world scenarios underexplored. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking diverse SciML models, including neural operators and vision transformer-based foundation models, for fluid flow prediction over intricate geometries. Using a high-fidelity dataset of steady-state flows across various geometries, we evaluate the impact of geometric representations -- Signed Distance Fields (SDF) and binary masks -- on model accuracy, scalability, and generalization. Central to this effort is the introduction of a novel, unified scoring framework that integrates metrics for global accuracy, boundary layer fidelity, and physical consistency to enable a robust, comparative evaluation of model performance. Our findings demonstrate that foundation models significantly outperform neural operators, particularly in data-limited scenarios, and that SDF representations yield superior results with sufficient training data. Despite these advancements, all models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, highlighting a critical challenge for future SciML applications. By advancing both evaluation methodologies and modeling capabilities, this work paves the way for robust and scalable ML solutions for fluid dynamics across complex geometries.

# Robust resonant anomaly detection with NPLM

**Authors:** Gaia Grosso, Debajyoti Sengupta, Tobias Golling, Philip Harris

arXiv:2501.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the application of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) algorithm as an alternative to the standard CWoLa method with Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs), particularly for scenarios with rare signal events. NPLM offers an end-to-end approach to anomaly detection and hypothesis testing by utilizing an in-sample evaluation of a binary classifier to estimate a log-density ratio, which can improve detection performance without prior assumptions on the signal model. We examine two approaches: (1) a end-to-end NPLM application in cases with reliable background modelling and (2) an NPLM-based classifier used for signal selection when accurate background modelling is unavailable, with subsequent performance enhancement through a hyper-test on multiple values of the selection threshold. Our findings show that NPLM-based methods outperform BDT-based approaches in detection performance, particularly in low signal injection scenarios, while significantly reducing epistemic variance due to hyperparameter choices. This work highlights the potential of NPLM for robust resonant anomaly detection in particle physics, setting a foundation for future methods that enhance sensitivity and consistency under signal variability.

Abstract: Accurately calculating energies and atomic forces with linear-scaling methods is a crucial approach to accelerating and improving molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we introduce HamGNN-DM, a machine learning model designed to predict atomic forces and energies using local density matrices in molecular dynamics simulations. This approach achieves efficient predictions with a time complexity of O(n), making it highly suitable for large-scale systems. Experiments in different systems demonstrate that HamGNN-DM achieves DFT-level precision in predicting the atomic forces in different system sizes, which is vital for the molecular dynamics. Furthermore, this method provides valuable electronic structure information throughout the dynamics and exhibits robust performance.

Abstract: Designing re-entry vehicles requires accurate predictions of hypersonic flow around their geometry. Rapid prediction of such flows can revolutionize vehicle design, particularly for morphing geometries. We evaluate advanced neural operator models such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), parameter-conditioned U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and MeshGraphNet, with the objective of addressing the challenge of learning geometry-dependent hypersonic flow fields with limited data. Specifically, we compare the performance of these models for two grid types: uniform Cartesian and irregular grids. To train these models, we use 36 unique elliptic geometries for generating high-fidelity simulations with a high-order entropy-stable DGSEM solver, emphasizing the challenge of working with a scarce dataset. We evaluate and compare the four operator-based models for their efficacy in predicting hypersonic flow field around the elliptic body. Moreover, we develop a novel framework, called Fusion DeepONet, which leverages neural field concepts and generalizes effectively across varying geometries. Despite the scarcity of training data, Fusion DeepONet achieves performance comparable to parameter-conditioned U-Net on uniform grids while it outperforms MeshGraphNet and vanilla DeepONet on irregular, arbitrary grids. Fusion DeepONet requires significantly fewer trainable parameters as compared to U-Net, MeshGraphNet, and FNO, making it computationally efficient. We also analyze the basis functions of the Fusion DeepONet model using Singular Value Decomposition. This analysis reveals that Fusion DeepONet generalizes effectively to unseen solutions and adapts to varying geometries and grid points, demonstrating its robustness in scenarios with limited training data.

Abstract: For this study, we compared the attitudes and beliefs about science of physical science (physics and mathematics) and life science (biochemistry and biology) students at the beginning of their university degrees using the CLASS (Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) tool. It is worth noting that both groups of students received similar physics courses during their high-school education. Through a detailed analysis of the different categories of the test, we examined the differences in performance in each of the areas that make up the questionnaire. Among other aspects, we found that a considerable percentage of life science students (higher than that of physical science students) adopted a novice type of behavior in problem solving. Finally, we discussed the possible causes of the differences found and their implications for teaching.

Abstract: Computational cardiovascular flow modeling plays a crucial role in understanding blood flow dynamics. While 3D models provide acute details, they are computationally expensive, especially with fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. 1D models offer a computationally efficient alternative, by simplifying the 3D Navier-Stokes equations through axisymmetric flow assumption and cross-sectional averaging. However, traditional 1D models based on finite element methods (FEM) often lack accuracy compared to 3D averaged solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-constrained machine learning technique that enhances the accuracy of 1D blood flow models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach, utilizing a physics-constrained coupled neural differential equation (PCNDE) framework, demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional FEM-based 1D models across a wide range of inlet boundary condition waveforms and stenosis blockage ratios. A key innovation lies in the spatial formulation of the momentum conservation equation, departing from the traditional temporal approach and capitalizing on the inherent temporal periodicity of blood flow. This spatial neural differential equation formulation switches space and time and overcomes issues related to coupling stability and smoothness, while simplifying boundary condition implementation. The model accurately captures flow rate, area, and pressure variations for unseen waveforms and geometries. We evaluate the model's robustness to input noise and explore the loss landscapes associated with the inclusion of different physics terms. This advanced 1D modeling technique offers promising potential for rapid cardiovascular simulations, achieving computational efficiency and accuracy. By combining the strengths of physics-based and data-driven modeling, this approach enables fast and accurate cardiovascular simulations.

Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) is a powerful imaging technique for capturing microvasculature and blood flow at high spatial resolution. However, accurate microbubble (MB) localization remains a key challenge, as errors in localization can propagate through subsequent stages of the super-resolution process, affecting overall performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of ensemble learning techniques to enhance MB localization by increasing detection sensitivity and reducing false positives. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of ensemble methods on both in vivo and simulated outputs of a Deformable DEtection TRansformer (Deformable DETR) network. As a result of our study, we are able to demonstrate the advantages of these ensemble approaches by showing improved precision and recall in MB detection and offering insights into their application in SR-US.

**Authors:** Barbara, Almaguer

Crystal polymorphism is an important and fascinating aspect of solid state chemistry with far reaching implications in the pharmaceuticals, agrisciences, nutraceuticals, battery and aviation industries. Late appearing more stable polymorphs have caused numerous issues in the pharmaceutical industry. Experimental polymorph screening can be very expensive and time consuming, and sometimes may miss important low energy polymorphs due to an inability to exhaust all crystallization conditions. In this paper, we report a crystal structure prediction (CSP) method with state of the art accuracy and efficiency, validated on a large and diverse dataset including 66 molecules with 137 experimentally known polymorphic forms. The method combines a novel systematic crystal packing search algorithm and the use of machine learning force fields in a hierarchical crystal energy ranking. Our method not only reproduces all the experimentally known polymorphs, but also suggests new low energy polymorphs yet to be discovered by experiment that might pose potential risks to development of the currently known forms of these compounds. In addition, we report the prediction results of a blinded study, results for Target XXXI from the seventh CSP blind test, and demonstrate how the method can be used to accelerate clinical formulation design and derisk downstream processing. The high accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of our method with large scale validations, and a blinded study, position it for routine molecular crystal structure prediction in drug development.

# Periodicity-aware deep learning for polymers

## 聚合物的周期性感知深度学习

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g2mbp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Jian, Ji

Deep learning has revolutionized chemical research by accelerating the discovery of new substances and enhancing the understanding of complex chemical systems. However, polymer chemistry, one of the most active branches of chemistry, has yet to establish a unified deep learning framework due to the complexity of polymer structures. Existing self-supervised learning methods for polymers simplify them into repeating units and neglect their inherent periodicity, thereby limiting the models’ ability to generalize across various tasks. To address this challenge, we herein propose a periodicity-aware deep learning framework for polymers (named PerioGT). In pre-training, a chemical knowledge-driven periodicity prior is constructed and incorporated into the model through contrastive learning. Then, periodicity prompts are learned in fine-tuning based on the periodicity prior to better leveraging the knowledge acquired in pre-training. Additionally, a novel graph augmentation strategy is employed for polymers, which integrates additional conditions via virtual nodes to effectively model complex chemical interactions. PerioGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 downstream tasks. Moreover, wet-lab experiments in antimicrobial polymer discovery highlight PerioGT’s potential in the real world, identifying two polymers with potent antimicrobial properties. All the results demonstrate that introducing the periodicity prior of polymers effectively improves the model performance.

# Is BigSMILES the Friend of Polymer Machine Learning?

## BigSMILES是聚合物机器学习的朋友吗？

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bxxhh-v5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Zhao-Yan, Sun

Machine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool in polymer science, with its success strongly relying on effective structural representations of polymers. While the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is widely used due to its simplicity, it was originally designed for small molecules and struggles to capture the stochastic nature of polymers. Recently, BigSMILES has been introduced as a more compact and versatile representation of polymer structures. However, the relative performance of SMILES and BigSMILES in polymer ML tasks remains unexplored.
In this study, we systematically evaluate SMILES and BigSMILES across 12 polymer-related tasks, including property prediction and inverse design, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and large language models (LLMs).  Our results show that BigSMILES enables faster training times due to its reduced token complexity, and achieves comparable or superior performance to SMILES in certain predictive tasks. Moreover, BigSMILES more accurately encodes chemical information and monomer connectivity for copolymers within LLM frameworks. This work serves as a starting point for a comprehensive evaluation of SMILES and BigSMILES in polymer ML applications, highlighting the potential of BigSMILES to streamline and accelerate polymer informatics workflows, particularly for complex systems like copolymers and polymer composites. Looking ahead, advancing polymer representations to integrate polymer chain structure, phase morphology, and processing parameters will be crucial for capturing the multifaceted relationships between polymer structure and properties, driving more accurate and efficient modeling.

This study explores the use of machine learning models (ML) to transform localized loop detector (LD) speeds into spatial link speeds for accurate estimation of network macroscopic fundamental diagrams ( NMFDs). We compare the performance of Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost models, using a comprehensive dataset to evaluate their effectiveness in aligning LD speeds with floating car device (FCD) as ground truth average speed. The RF model showed the highest accuracy, with a 37.44% improvement over original LDD speeds and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 9.54 km/hr. Additionally, we investigated the impact of LD positions and demand by separating loading and unloading periods. The RF model's adjustments were especially effective under these conditions, resulting in an improved accuracy of 44.9%. Our analysis of NMFDs further validated the RF model's robustness and accurate estimation of NMFDs using corrected LDD.

# A Webshell Detection Method Based on Multi-Feature Fusion and Federated Learning

## 基于多特征融合和联邦学习的Webshell检测方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5748302/latest

Webshell attacks have become a prevalent strategy in the arsenal of network intruders, enabling them to seize a measure of control over web servers and execute malicious operations. These incursions are particularly insidious due to their covert nature, with attackers perpetually devising fresh Webshell variants to sidestep security measures. Compounding the issue is the shortfall in information exchange and collaboration among server networks, which leads to a patchwork of detection capabilities against Webshell threats. This fragmentation hampers the development of a unified and potent defense architecture.This scholarly work introduces a cutting-edge Webshell detection technique founded on the principles of federated learning, tailored to overcome the aforementioned challenges. The proposed method amalgamates a diverse array of features from various tiers of Webshell analysis, including source code, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) sequence features, and Opcode sequence features, along with a suite of statistical attributes such as code structure features, text obfuscation metrics, and indicators reflecting Cybersecurity expertise and experience. The research constructs a TextCNN-based neural network architecture specifically attuned to learning the malevolent behaviors exhibited by Webshell samples. In parallel, the study leverages the FedAvg algorithm from the realm of federated learning, coupled with the DP-SGD optimizer, to facilitate collaborative training across numerous participants while ensuring that data remains within their respective domains. This approach not only upholds data privacy but also forestalls the leak of sensitive information.The empirical findings from the experiments conducted on the AMWD&rsquo;22 dataset are resoundingly positive. The proposed method&rsquo;s model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 99.47%, complemented by an F-1 score of 99.67%, signifying superior detection capabilities when compared to alternative models. Furthermore, the rigorous design of federated learning experiments for comparative analysis has successfully validated that the model&rsquo;s accuracy can be enhanced from an already high baseline of 98.01% to an even more remarkable 99.01%, all while ensuring that data remains within its original domain, thus preserving privacy and security.

# COLLAR: Combating Low-rank Temporal Latent Representation for High-dimensional Multivariate Time Series Prediction using Dynamic Koopman Regularization

## COLLAR: 使用动态Koopman正则化对抗高维多变量时间序列预测的低秩时间潜在表示

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5740002/latest

Recent advancements in high-dimensional multivariate time series forecasting have yielded promising outcomes by effectively capturing temporal dynamics within a low-dimensional latent subspace. While Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) excel at learning temporal models in reduced-dimensional spaces, the simplistic structure of the decoder fails to capture the diversity present in the observed data. Conversely, introducing a more intricate encoder might exacerbate the risk of overfitting. In response to this susceptibility, we propose COLLAR &ndash; an innovative architecture that employs dynamic linearized regularization. COLLAR aims to reconcile the inherent nonlinear temporal structures present in low-dimensional subspaces with the linear evolution of multivariate time series. Specifically, we utilize the Auto-Encoder (AE) as the backbone, facilitating the factorization of multivariable time series into a low-dimensional subspace. We construct a nonlinear prediction model for latent sequences using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). To learn linear dynamics, we integrate the data-driven Koopman operator with a modified AE architecture to generate linear dynamics regularization terms, thereby constraining the uncertainty in nonlinear prediction. The eigenfunctions derived from the Koopman operator provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics, enabling the prediction of the next state to depend solely on the current state. The proposed approach is evaluated across five publicly available datasets and outperforms several competitive baselines. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Nsyyyy/COLLAR.

# Enhancing the Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning on Routine Full-Breast Mammograms

## 在常规全乳腺钼靶上使用深度学习增强早期乳腺癌淋巴结转移的预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5728087/latest

Background: With a trend toward de-escalation of axillary surgery in breast cancer, prediction models incorporating imaging modalities can help reassess the need for surgical axillary staging. Although mammography is routinely performed for breast cancer imaging, its potential in nodal staging remains underutilized. This study aims to employ advancements in deep learning (DL) to comprehensively evaluate the potential of routine mammograms for predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) in preoperative clinical settings.
Methods: This retrospective study included 1,265 cN0 T1-T2 breast cancer patients, comprising 368 node-positive and 897 node-negative cases, diagnosed from 2009-2017 at three Swedish institutions. Patients diagnosed in 2017 were assigned to the independent test set (n=123, site 2) and the external test set (n=103, site 3), while the remaining patients (n=1,039, site 1 and 2) were used for model development and double cross-validation. A neck module, in conjunction with a ResNet backbone pretrained on unlabeled mammograms, was developed to extract global information from full-breast or region-of-interest (ROI) mammograms by predicting five cancer outcomes. Clinicopathological characteristics were combined with the learned mammogram features to predict LNM collaboratively. The models were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), calibration, and decision curve analysis.
Results: Compared to models using only clinical variables, &amp;nbsp;incorporating full-breast mammograms with preoperative clinical variables improved the ROC AUC from 0.690 &plusmn; 0.063 (SD) to 0.774 &plusmn; 0.057 in the independent test set and from 0.584 &plusmn; 0.068 to 0.637 &plusmn; 0.063 in the external test set. The combined model showed good calibration and, at sensitivity &ge; 90%, achieved a better net benefit, and a higher sentinel lymph node biopsy reduction rate of 41.7% in the independent test set. Full-breast mammograms showed comparable ability to tumor ROIs in predicting LNM.
Conclusion: Our findings underscore that routine mammograms, particularly full-breast images, can enhance preoperative nodal status prediction. They may substitute key postoperative predictors such as pathological tumor size and multifocality, aiding patient stratification before surgery. Interestingly, the added predictive value of mammography was consistent across all sites, whereas the overall performance varied over time periods and sites, likely due to advancements in equipment and procedures.

Then, we created a Selenium automated algorithm that works continuously. However, each part of our project will be defined step-by-step in detail. We have also created an algorithm, which is attached in this article. Finally, we have achieved the desired results and are still researching ways to improve the model.

The advent of single-cell sequencing has revolutionized the study of cellular dynamics, providing unprecedented resolution into the molecular states and heterogeneity of individual cells. However, the rich potential of exon-level information and junction reads within single cells remains underutilized. Conventional gene-count methods overlook critical exon and junction data, limiting the quality of cell representation and downstream analyses such as subpopulation identification and alternative splicing detection. We introduce DOLPHIN, a deep learning method that integrates exon-level and junction read data, representing genes as graph structures. These graphs are processed by a variational graph autoencoder to improve cell embeddings. DOLPHIN not only demonstrates superior performance in cell clustering, biomarker discovery, and alternative splicing detection but also provides a distinct capability to detect subtle transcriptomic differences at the exon level that are often masked in gene-level analyses. By examining cellular dynamics with enhanced resolution, DOLPHIN provides new insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

# Mean&ndash;Variance Portfolio Optimization Using Ensemble Learning-Based Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

## 基于集成学习的加密货币价格预测的均值-方差投资组合优化

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5734118/latest

The success of portfolio construction largely relies on accurately forecasting future asset performance. Advances in machine learning present significant opportunities to integrate prediction theory into portfolio selection. &nbsp;However, some studies indicate that relying on a single prediction model may lead to biased forecasts or suboptimal portfolio outcomes due to individual algorithms' inherent limitations and assumptions. This study proposes an ensemble learning approach for portfolio optimization by combining advanced predictive analytics with classical mean-variance (MV) models as a two-stage methodology. To do so, seven machine learning models, including LSTM, BLSTM, GRU, DMLP, RF, XGBoost, and SVR, are combined using ensemble approaches such as ridge regression (RR) and principal component regression (PCR). Next, the future insights are integrated into the MV framework to optimize asset allocations, aiming to balance risk and return effectively. An empirical analysis of top cryptocurrencies showed that ensemble learning improves prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the integration of forecasting results with the MV framework outperformed traditional approaches in terms of risk-adjusted returns and portfolio stability.

The ability to understand and process websites is crucial across various domains. It lays the foundation for machine understanding of websites. Specifically, website embedding proves invaluable when monitoring local government websites within the context of digital transformation. In this paper, we present a comparison of different state-of-the-art website embedding methods and their capability of creating a reasonable website embedding for our specific task. The models consist of visual, mixed, and textual-based embedding methods. We compare the models with a baseline model which embeds the header section of a website. We measure the performance of the models using zero-shot and transfer learning. We evaluate the performance of the models on three different datasets. Additionally to the embedding scoring, we evaluate the classification performance on these datasets. From the zero-shot models Homepage2Vec with visual, a combination of visual and textual embedding, performs best in general over all datasets. When applying transfer learning, MarkupLM, a markup language-based model, outperforms the others in both cluster scoring as well as precision and F1-score in the classification task. However, time is an important factor when it comes to processing large data quantities. Thus, when additionally considering the time needed, our baseline model is a good alternative, being 1.88 times faster with a maximum decrease of 10 % in the F1-score.

# Transferable polychromatic optical encoder for neural networks

## 用于神经网络的可转移多色光学编码器

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5367125/latest

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have fundamentally transformed the field of computer vision, providing unprecedented performance. However, these ANNs for image processing demand substantial computational resources, often hindering real-time operation. In this paper, we demonstrate an optical encoder that can perform convolution simultaneously in three color channels during the image capture, effectively implementing several initial convolutional layers of a ANN. Such an optical encoding results in ~24,000 times reduction in computational operations, with a state-of-the art classification accuracy (~ 73.2%) in free-space optical system. In addition, our analog optical encoder, trained for CIFAR-10 data, can be transferred to the ImageNet subset, High-10, without any modifications, and still exhibits moderate accuracy. Our results evidence the potential of hybrid optical/digital computer vision system in which the optical frontend can pre-process an ambient scene to reduce the energy and latency of the whole computer vision system.

# System biology based integrative analysis to predict early biomarkers for COVID-related MIS in children

## 基于系统生物学的综合分析预测儿童COVID相关MIS的早期生物标志物

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5759195/latest

The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has introduced unparalleled difficulties, including the appearance of a rare but serious condition in children referred to as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This syndrome, marked by an overactive immune response resulting in extensive inflammation throughout various organ systems, has underscored the pressing necessity for predictive biomarkers to enhance early diagnosis and treatment. This research aimed to fill this gap using a comprehensive bioinformatics approach, applying fold-change and adjusted p-value techniques to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DESeq2 was utilized to enhance these biomarkers, ensuring a strong and precise selection procedure. To accurately predict MIS-C biomarkers, numerous machine learning classifiers were evaluated, and the Random Forest model excelled compared to the rest. It showed a significant accuracy of 0.81 for moderate DEGs, confirming its appropriateness for biomarker prediction in COVID-19-related MIS-C. The results highlight the strength of computational biology in understanding the molecular processes associated with intricate conditions such as MIS-C, facilitating focused exploration of treatment approaches. Through in silico analysis and visualisation, a particular drug ligand named Methylprednisolone came out to an ideal candidate that shows favourable binding affinity with the genes deduced from ML analysis. This study not only clarifies the pathophysiology of MIS-C but also opens avenues for utilizing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques in clinical studies. By connecting computational and clinical fields, this study marks an important advancement in reducing the effects of severe COVID-19-related issues in children.
