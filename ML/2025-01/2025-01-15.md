Safe and efficient operation of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels depends on early defect detection during manufacturing. &lsquo;Bright spots&rsquo; on Electro-Luminescence (EL) images of Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are critical defects, leading to excess energy production, short circuits, overheating, and potential fires. After extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, this paper proposes a robust approach for reliable bright spot detection based on image classification using novel features and synthetic bright spot EL images generated by generative adversarial networks (GANs). The proposed approach achieved an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.9526 signifying its real-world applicability for reliable bright spot detection in PV solar panels.

# Ether-linked phospholipidomic profiling unveils novel lipid fingerprints and algorithm predicts the future development of carotid plaques in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study

## 醚连接的磷脂谱揭示了新的脂质指纹和算法预测绝经后妇女颈动脉斑块的未来发展: 一项基于人群的队列研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5738378/latest

Background
Serum ether-linked phospholipids (ePLs) have gained attention in metabolic disease research. Postmenopausal women face a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis (AS), yet current methods for risk prediction and understanding of AS pathophysiology remain limited. This study aimed to identify ePL biomarkers linked to AS, assess their chemical composition in relation to AS risk, and explore whether their impact is mediated by clinical risk factors in postmenopausal women.
Methods
Here, this research was conducted within the Rose Asymptomatic Intracranial Artery Stenosis (RICAS) prospective study and included 203 postmenopausal women without carotid plaques at baseline. After a median follow-up of 3.8 years, 51 participants developed new carotid plaques. Baseline serum ePLs were semi-quantitated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
Results
The mean age of participants was 60.51 (&plusmn;7.83) years. A total of 85 unique ePL species across five lipid subclasses were identified and quantified according to lipid internal standards. Multivariate models indicated global metabolic disruptions in ePLs preceding carotid plaque formation. Six ePLs were identified as potential biomarkers associated with AS risk (VIP &amp;gt; 1, p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR &amp;lt; 0.05). After adjusting for age, BMI, TG, and LDL-C, four polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing ePLs remained significantly associated with carotid plaque risk (OR &amp;gt; 1, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Causal mediation analysis indicated that LDL-C mediated the effects of these ePLs on AS. A machine-learning model incorporating these ePLs with clinical parameters significantly improved carotid plaque prediction (AUC: 0.835, Net Reclassification Improvement &amp;gt; 0, p &amp;lt; 0.001).
Conclusion
This study highlighted importance of metabolic disruption in PUFA-ePLs for the development of AS. Our findings support the notion that metabolic disruption of PUFA-ePLs can affect LDL-C levels, which is the primary driver of AS in postmenopausal women. Ether-linked phospholipidome as a valuable phenotype hold potential clinical utility in the prediction of AS.

## 使用支持向量机算法对a型主动脉夹层患者的长期生存进行可解释的预后建模

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5786813/latest

Objective This study aims to develop a reliable and interpretable predictive model for the risk of long-term survival in type A aortic dissection (TAAD) patients, utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms.Methods  We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data diagnosed with Type A Aortic Dissection (TAAD) who underwent open surgical repair at our institution between September 2017 and December 2020. Cases with less than 20% missing data were imputed using random forest algorithms. To identify significant prognostic factors, we performed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Cox regression analysis, including preoperative blood markers, previous medical history and perioperative condition. Based on the advantages of the model and the characteristics of the dataset, we subsequently developed a machine learning-based prognostic model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and evaluated its performance across key metrics. To further explain the decision-making process of the SVM model, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values for model interpretation.Results A total of 175 patients with TAAD were included in the study. Through LASSO Cox regression, univariate analysis, and clinical relevance assessment, eight feature variables were selected for modeling. Performance evaluation revealed that the SVM model showed excellent performance in both the training and test sets, with no significant overfitting, indicating strong clinical applicability. In the training set, the model achieved an AUC of 0.9247 (95% CI: 0.9200&amp;ndash;0.9279), and in the testing set, 0.8800 (95% CI: 0.8492&amp;ndash;0.9396). The accuracy was 0.8663 and 0.8857, precision was 0.8627 and 1.0000, recall was 0.8713 and 0.7333, F1 score was 0.8670 and 0.8462, Brier score was 0.1068 and 0.1070, average precision (AP) was 0.9266 and 0.9086, and C-index was 0.8901 and 0.8700, respectively. SHAP analysis identified that longer ICU hospital stay, abdominal pain, plasma transfusion volume, creatinine, white blood cell count, operation time, and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) had significant positive impact on the model's predictions.Conclusion This study developed an interpretable predictive model based on the SVM algorithm to assess long-term survival in TAAD patients. The model demonstrated accuracy, precision, and robustness in identifying high-risk patients, providing clinicians with reliable evidence for prognosis management.

## 柔软假手的设计与制作

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5812474/latest

This study focuses on the development of soft robotic hand designed to aid individuals with hand disabilities, particularly those paralyzed due to strokes. Globally, strokes affect 15 million people annually, leading to 5 million deaths and leaving another 5 million with permanent disabilities that significantly impact their lives and communities. The soft robotic hand developed attempts to addresses the limitations of traditional robotic hands through the use of PneuNets, a pneumatic network framework that mimics the structure and function of a human hand. The hand's design incorporates pneumatic chambers that enable controlled finger movements, essential for grasping, lifting, and manipulating objects with precision. The primary components of the hand were fabricated using additive manufacturing and molding techniques, with a silicone outer layer added to enhance safety and compliance. The microcontroller-based control system is tailored to execute desired actions effectively, ensuring the soft hand&rsquo;s adaptability to various tasks. Performance evaluations involved both simple and complex task profiles, demonstrating the hand's capability to handle a variety of objects with low variability in force and high precision. Specific technical results include the measurement of grasping forces, pressure requirements for actuation, and the assessment of attenuation losses during operation. Prior designs of soft robotic hands often suffer from issues like single-mode gripping and high attenuation losses; our approach mitigates these challenges through an optimized mechanical design coupled with learning algorithms that enhance grasping and manipulation efficiency. The soft characteristics of the robotic hand allow it to adapt its shape, making it capable of handling objects of varying sizes and shapes, thereby improving the daily functionality for individuals with hand impairments. This novel design not only offers increased independence and quality of life for patients but also provides a cost-effective and easily producible solution for wearable soft robotics.

# Enhancing high school students&rsquo; understanding and attitude towards quantum mechanics through discipline- culture framework and cognitive apprenticeship

## 通过学科文化框架和认知学徒制提高高中生对量子力学的理解和态度

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5323874/latest

Background: The second quantum revolution is in progress, driven by rapid advancements in quantum technology (QT), promising significant job creation and socio-economic impact. Early exposure of students to quantum mechanics (QM) is essential to meet the growing demand for a quantum-competent workforce for the QT industry. Despite this, students typically encounter QM only at the university level, often after finalising their career pathways. Global efforts are underway to introduce QM and QT at the high school level. However, QT outreach programs integrated into sustainable school-led activities are rare, with most initiatives led by government-funded research agencies.
Purpose: We present the findings from a school-initiated quantum education and outreach endeavour implemented through a completely online STEM &amp;amp; Research Internship Program (SRIP) for high school students in the Philippines. The program aimed to introduce QM and QT to students, enhance their understanding of QM and QT, improve their attitude towards QM, and introduce them to career opportunities in the QT industry.
Sample: Twenty students (eleven males, nine females) studying in Grades 9- 11 from four campuses of a STEM-focused high school in the Philippines participated in the study.
Research design:We employed a quasi-experimental research design, utilizing a single-group pre- and post-test format with a mixed-methods approach for data collection. The SRIP, completed in eighty hours over two weeks, served as the intervention. Our theoretical framework combined the discipline-culture (DC) approach and the cognitive apprenticeship (CA) model for teaching physics.
Method: First, we used the DC framework to design a structured curriculum introducing QM and QT to high school students. The DC framework organises the curriculum into three components- core principles of the discipline (nucleus), their applications (body), and misconceptions, contrasting ideas or future developments that directly challenge the core principles (periphery). Next, we used the CA model to implement the curriculum and deliver the learning material. Within the CA model, a variety of research-based pedagogies were employed, including the flipped classroom, guided inquiry, games and simulations, project-based learning and educational videos to effectively deliver the learning material incorporating our designed curriculum.
Data collection: We utilized research-validated instruments for pre-and post-tests, including the Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey (QPCS), the Quantum Technology Inventory (QTI), and the Attitude Towards Quantum Mechanics (ATQM) survey to gather quantitative data on students&rsquo; understanding of QM and their attitude towards the subject. Furthermore, we collected qualitative data from students&rsquo; daily journal entries, where they reflected on their experiences by responding to open-ended questions. We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to perform an inferential analysis of the QPCS and ATQM survey, while QTI was evaluated using descriptive statistics. Additionally, the qualitative data, derived from students&rsquo; daily journal entries, was analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
Results: We observed a statistically significant positive shift (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in students&rsquo; knowledge of quantum mechanics and their attitude towards the discipline. The descriptive statistics from the QTI further indicate an improvement in students&rsquo; understanding of concepts related to QT. The themes emerging from the qualitative data also indicated positive experiences, improved understanding of quantum phenomena, and more favourable attitudes toward QM after the program
Conclusion: The results, supported by data and method triangulation, demonstrate the program&rsquo;s positive educational impact, particularly as the first school-initiated quantum outreach initiative of its kind. The SRIP successfully met its objectives by improving high school students&rsquo; understanding of advanced QM and QT concepts while fostering a positive attitude towards QM. Additionally, students reported healthy interactions with peers and mentors&mdash;crucial elements for their holistic development.

# A Practical Inverse Design Approach for High-Entropy Catalysts with Generative AI

## 具有生成AI的高熵催化剂的实用逆设计方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5712388/latest

The vast compositional space of high-entropy materials offers unprecedented opportunities for the development of powerful catalysts. However, their inverse design remains unfeasible due to the lack of robust theoretical frameworks and high-throughput experimental tools. This study demonstrates a practical inverse design approach that integrates spectroscopic descriptors, generative machine learning, and a robotic experimental platform to synthesize and optimize catalyst composition for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The automated system significantly accelerated catalysts design and experimental validation, reducing the time required for synthesis, characterization and performance testing from approximately 20 hours to only 78 minutes per sample. Following a rapid screen for efficient senary high-entropy catalysts, the spectroscopic generative model further optimized the top-performing candidate, lowering its overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 by an additional 32 mV. Our findings are a testament to the potential of an inverse design approach that incorporates spectroscopic descriptors into generative machine learning to accelerate catalyst discovery. Moreover, this approach is also expected to drive the intelligent design of high-performance complex materials.

# Hybrid Graph Learning Reconstructs Global Ocean Oxygen Spatiotemporal Changes

## 混合图学习重构全球海洋氧时空变化

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5587966/latest

Climate change and anthropogenic activities have exacerbated hypoxic conditions in the global ocean, threatening marine ecosystems and earth sustainability. Investigating the history of ocean deoxygenation is crucial for developing coping strategies. However, due to the severe sparse in-situ observations and spatiotemporal complexity of deoxygenation mechanism, precise modelling of the oxygen trends, especially in large scale, remains a long-standing problem. Here we propose Jingwei, a hybrid graph learning framework that integrates observation data and ocean climate model in a complementary manner, accurately reconstructing global oxygen levels over the past six decades. A knowledge retrieval module is designed to learn the hidden laws that dominate the complex mechanism of oxygen changes from model-based simulations. Constrained by those laws, a knowledge propagation module spatiotemporally connects the sparse data, capturing dynamic and spatial heterogeneous oxygen loss. With a joint consideration of invariant laws and variant factors, Jingwei significantly reduces reconstruction error, achieving equal accuracy with the dense cruise surveys. It can quantitatively trace the expansion process of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ), revealing potential drivers, effectively supporting on-target strategies. We foresee that the implications of such a graph-based hybrid framework extend beyond ocean deoxygenation and pave way for next-generation earth system modelling.

# A Deep Learning Method for Non-Uniform Flow Field Based on KAN and MLP Neural Networks

## 基于KAN和MLP神经网络的非均匀流场深度学习方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5809608/latest

Fluid-solid interaction(FSI) has always been a hot topic in the field of fluid mechanics. Because the flow field of FSI is highly inhomogeneous, when the initial conditions change with time, the inhomogeneity of the flow field in time and space will be further aggravated. The forward and inverse solutions of physical information neural networks (PINNs) in fluid mechanics have been widely studied and significant progress has been made. The technology of learning and reconstructing the flow field with PINNs is relatively mature. However, there are still large errors in predicting the flow field with uneven temporal and spatial distribution. Neural networks(NN) cannot capture some local details in learning. In addition, the generalization characteristics of NNs will also weaken the learning of local highlight areas. Therefore, inspired by the confidence weight, this paper proposes a local reinforcement learning (LRL) method to solve the above problems. It is found that LRL has a good effect on local learning. Based on the LRL method, the applicability of three different NN frameworks in the reconstruction of FSI flow fields is tested, namely, multilayer perceptron(MLP), KAN and KAN&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;MLP. For the MLP framework, the details of the inhomogeneous flow field can be learned more accurately. For the KAN framework, by setting different depths and widths for NN, it is found that the prediction accuracy of KAN does not depend on the scale of NN, but has specific settings for specific problems. However, when applying the LRL method, the prediction effect of KAN is not particularly ideal, so the KAN&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;MLP framework is proposed as an improved method. The prediction effect is relatively ideal, but it takes a lot of time to train. In this study, the performance of the new framework KAN in inhomogeneous flow field is tested, which provides ideas and basis for further research on its application scope and practical effect in fluid mechanics.
