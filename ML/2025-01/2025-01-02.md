# A Meaningful Machine Learning Model for Predicting Amputation Rate of Patients with Diabetic Foot

## 预测糖尿病足患者截肢率的有意义机器学习模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5716696/latest

Background. Diabetic foot (DF) is a destructive complication of diabetes,which has high amputation rate and causes great social burden. With the development of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need for an accurate prediction method for the prognosis of chronic diseases.
Methods. This retrospective study collected the data of 149 patients with DF from January 2019 to December 2022. The data &amp;nbsp;was divided into the test set and training set by 5-fold cross-validation. Then we used Lasso algorithm to screen relevant risk factors, and the predictive model was built with support vector mechanism(SVM) to forecast probability. Combining multiple methods such as receiver operating characteristic, calibration, and risk decision curve for multimodal analysis of the model.
Results. Statistical analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences in CRP, PCT, WBC and Wagner grading between the training and testing sets (P＜0.05). According to the results of multiple factor analysis, CRP and Wagner rating 3-4 were the independent predictive factors for generalized amputation.The area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves of themodel were 0.89. This model&rsquo;s calibration capability was 19.614 through Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p=0.012).When the threshold value was selected as 0.302, the constructed model was able to generate a net gain of 0.351.
Conclusion. The predictive model we constructed can accurately estimate the rate of amputation during hospitalization in DFU patients. Our survey data suggested that C-reactive protein(CRP) and the Wagner grade of the affected foot might play a vital role in predicting diabetic foot amputation.

# Teacher noticing in inclusive mathematics education: Analyzing its structure and expert-novice differences using a novel video-based test instrument

## 教师在全纳数学教育中的注意事项: 使用一种新颖的基于视频的测试一下工具分析其结构和专家-新手差异

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5738066/latest

Teachers&amp;rsquo; professional noticing&amp;mdash;often conceptualized as their situation-specific skills of perception, interpretation and decision-making&amp;mdash;constitutes an important component of their professional competence. Noticing has become increasingly significant worldwide in the pursuit of inclusive mathematics education in classroom settings, whereby teachers are required to provide equal opportunities for students across all ability levels. However, current teacher noticing frameworks lack the requisite specificity to support inclusive mathematics education, particularly regarding diagnostic applications and adequate learning support, and thus a revision of existing frameworks is warranted. On the one hand, such frameworks must incorporate selected facets of teacher knowledge, including mathematical pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) and general pedagogical knowledge (GPK) specified for inclusive teaching; on the other hand, the differentiation into dispositions and situation-specific skills as decisive components of competence viewed as a continuum must be considered, as Sigrid Bl&amp;ouml;meke et al. suggested in their seminal framework. This paper describes the methodological challenges associated with the development of standardized instruments to measure teachers&amp;rsquo; professional knowledge and noticing within inclusive mathematics education, as undertaken by the project Teacher Education and Development Study &amp;ndash; Inclusive Mathematics Education (TEDS-IME). Using a large sample of 628 pre-service and in-service teachers, the paper aims to examine the dimensionality of teachers&amp;rsquo; competence for inclusive mathematics education and expert&amp;ndash;novice differences in the pattern of their competence facets. Our findings indicate that the newly developed video-based instrument for teachers&amp;rsquo; noticing in inclusive mathematics education serves as a reliable and multidimensional measurement for both pre-service and in-service teachers.

# Advancing UAV Landing Precision: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Classifiers for Human Detection

## 提高无人机着陆精度: 用于人体检测的深度学习分类器的比较研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5709691/latest

This study introduces and implements the use of evidence-based deep learning and Dirichlet distribution for optimal mobility and landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A new evidence-based deep learning model is developed by defining a new loss function on multiple datasets of aerial images captured by drones. The purpose is to identify and process the presence or absence of humans in the landing environment. In this paper we propose a novel deep learning architecture that is capable of providing uncertainty in classification and that can be deployed for input samples. Our project and implemented model are compared with other existing and robust models such as EfficientNET, DenseNet, MobileNet, VGG 16 and 19, Yolov8 and Resnet50. The results show that the use of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) shows higher accuracy in detecting human presence or absence compared to other existing models. We also model and assess uncertainty for all models used. The use of different models shows the inverse relationship between reliability and uncertainty in person detection in UAVs (higher reliability at the same time as lower uncertainty and vice versa).

# Analyzing Discourse Patterns in ChatGPT-Generated IELTS Writing Task 2 Essays: A Discourse Analysis Approach

## 分析ChatGPT生成的雅思写作任务2论文中的话语模式: 话语分析方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5608928/latest

This study examines the discourse features of ChatGPT-generated IELTS Writing Task 2 essays, with a focus on the specific characteristics associated with band descriptors for scores of 6 and 7.Utilizing discourse and content analyses approaches, the studyexamines coherence, cohesion, argument structure, and lexical resource to understand the discourse characteristics indicative of different proficiency levels. Findings reveal that band 6 essays exhibit basic coherence with abrupt transitions and limited use of cohesive devices which result in a more linear argument structure and simpler lexical choices. Conversely, band 7 essays demonstrate a clearer progression of ideas, enhanced cohesion through varied cohesive devices, and a more complex argument structure that effectively integrates counterarguments and depth of analysis. These discourse patterns underscore the potential for AI-generated texts to model proficiency levels in writing and serve as pedagogical tools to improve learner outcomes. By highlighting the discourse elements critical to achieving higher band scores, this study contributes valuable insights into AI&amp;rsquo;s role in supporting language learning and academic writing proficiency.

# Influence of Study Time Differences on EEG Cross-Frequency Coupling During Working Memory Tasks

## 工作记忆任务中学习时间差异对EEG交叉频率耦合的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5622676/latest

This study explores the influence of long-term learning behavior on brain cross-frequency coupling (CFC) mechanisms and their effects on working memory. The research included 40 third-year university students from the same major, divided into two groups: one group (20 students) was actively involved in academic activities for three years, while the other group (20 students) had minimal academic engagement. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during resting-state and Sternberg Working Memory Task (STB) periods, the study analyzed changes in amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) to understand the relationship between learning behavior and cognitive function. During resting state, no significant differences in AAC and PAC were observed, suggesting stable neural networks. However, the STB task revealed significant differences in coupling in specific EEG channels: AAC differed notably in T8 and P3, while PAC showed distinctions in C3. These differences point to potential variations in information processing and cognitive regulation mechanisms between the groups. Although these variations did not directly impact task performance, they provide insights into how long-term learning affects neural processing pathways. This research highlights the importance of analyzing neural coupling patterns in specific cognitive tasks to assess the impact of educational interventions. The findings can guide the design of tailored educational strategies and cognitive training programs, underscoring the significance of long-term learning for brain function.

# A Hybrid E-Learning Recommendation System Incorporating User Reviews and Ratings for Enhanced Course Selection

## 结合用户评论和评分的混合电子学习推荐系统，用于增强课程选择

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5729775/latest

A recommendation system can be used in E-learning to suggest relevant and personalized resources. It uses data about learners' behaviors, such as the courses they have taken, the content they have viewed, and the assessments they have completed, to make recommendations for additional learning opportunities. In this work, we build a hybrid educational video recommender system based on learners&rsquo; reviews and ratings. We use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model on textual data extracted from educational videos to train language models as an input to a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Additionally, we use a Latent Factor Model (LFM) to extract educational video features and learners' preferences from their historical data (ratings and reviews) as an output CNN model. In our proposed technique, we use hybrid user ratings and reviews to tackle sparsity and cold start problems in the recommender system. Our recommender uses reviews to predict a new sentiment matrix. For cases where reviews are absent (represented as empty cells in the sentiment matrix) or comments are ambiguous, the system utilizes normalized user ratings from the rating matrix, employing a tailored mathematical framework specifically designed for this purpose.
