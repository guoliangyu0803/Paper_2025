# Transfer learning for multi-material classification of transition metal dichalcogenides with atomic force microscopy

## 基于原子力显微镜的过渡金属二硫化物多材料分类的迁移学习

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ada2da

**Authors:** Isaiah A Moses and Wesley F Reinhart

Deep learning models based on atomic force microscopy enhance efficiency in inverse design and characterization of materials. However, the limited and imbalanced data of experimental materials that are typically available is a major challenge. Also important is the need to interpret trained models, which are normally complex enough to be uninterpretable by humans. Here, we present a systemic evaluation of transfer learning strategies to accommodate low-data scenarios in materials synthesis and a model latent feature analysis to draw connections to the human-interpretable characteristics of the samples. While we imagine this framework can be used in downstream analysis tasks such as quantitative characterization, we demonstrate the strategies on a multi-material classification task for which the ground truth labels are readily available. Our models show accurate predictions in five classes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS2, WS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and Mo-WSe2) with up to 89% accuracy on held-out test samples. Analysis of the latent features reveals a correlation with physical characteristics such as grain density, Difference of Gaussian blob, and local variation. The transfer learning optimization modality and the exploration of the correlation between the latent and physical features provide important frameworks that can be applied to other classes of materials beyond TMDs to enhance the models’ performance and explainability which can accelerate the inverse design of materials for technological applications.

Abstract: We develop the laws of thermodynamics in terms of general exponential families. By casting learning (log-loss minimization) problems in max-entropy and statistical mechanics terms, we translate thermodynamics results to learning scenarios. We extend the well-known way in which exponential families characterize thermodynamic and learning equilibria. Basic ideas of work and heat, and advanced concepts of thermodynamic cycles and equipartition of energy, find exact and useful counterparts in AI / statistics terms. These ideas have broad implications for quantifying and addressing distribution shift.

# Establishing baselines for generative discovery of inorganic crystals

**Authors:** Nathan J. Szymanski, Christopher J. Bartel

arXiv:2501.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against three generative models: a variational autoencoder, a large language model, and a diffusion model. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although many of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability rate. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery.

# Predicting band gap from chemical composition: A simple learned model for a material property with atypical statistics

**Authors:** Andrew Ma, Owen Dugan, Marin Solja\v{c}i\'c

arXiv:2501.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solid-state materials science, substantial efforts have been devoted to the calculation and modeling of the electronic band gap. While a wide range of ab initio methods and machine learning algorithms have been created that can predict this quantity, the development of new computational approaches for studying the band gap remains an active area of research. Here we introduce a simple machine learning model for predicting the band gap using only the chemical composition of the crystalline material. To motivate the form of the model, we first analyze the empirical distribution of the band gap, which sheds new light on its atypical statistics. Specifically, our analysis enables us to frame band gap prediction as a task of modeling a mixed random variable, and we design our model accordingly. Our model formulation incorporates thematic ideas from chemical heuristic models for other material properties in a manner that is suited towards the band gap modeling task. The model has exactly one parameter corresponding to each element, which is fit using data. To predict the band gap for a given material, the model computes a weighted average of the parameters associated with its constituent elements and then takes the maximum of this quantity and zero. The model provides heuristic chemical interpretability by intuitively capturing the associations between the band gap and individual chemical elements.

Abstract: Although generative models hold promise for discovering molecules with optimized desired properties, they often fail to suggest synthesizable molecules that improve upon the known molecules seen in training. We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.

Abstract: Quantum annealing has garnered significant attention as meta-heuristics inspired by quantum physics for combinatorial optimization problems. Among its many applications, nonnegative/binary matrix factorization stands out for its complexity and relevance in unsupervised machine learning. The use of reverse annealing, a derivative procedure of quantum annealing to prioritize the search in a vicinity under a given initial state, helps improve its optimization performance in matrix factorization. This study proposes an improved strategy that integrates reverse annealing with a linear programming relaxation technique. Using relaxed solutions as the initial configuration for reverse annealing, we demonstrate improvements in optimization performance comparable to the exact optimization methods. Our experiments on facial image datasets show that our method provides better convergence than known reverse annealing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of relaxation-based initialization methods on randomized datasets, demonstrating a relationship between the relaxed solution and the optimal solution. This research underscores the potential of combining reverse annealing and classical optimization strategies to enhance optimization performance.

# Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers

**Authors:** Markus J. Buehler

arXiv:2501.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.

arXiv:2501.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium and sodium solid electrolytes feature polyanion frameworks and highly mobile cations. Understanding and quantifying the impact of polyanion dynamics on cations will help us to unravel the complex role that anion play in superionic conductors. However, no experimental or computational method can directly extract this information, as polyanion dynamics are always coupled with other factors that affect ion mobility. Here, we present the pioneering study that combines constraint algorithm and machine-learning molecular dynamics to quantitatively reveal the effects of polyanion translation, rotation, and vibration on cation mobility across a diverse material class. Ultralong-time, large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations with selective constraints on each anion motion mode unequivocally yield results at near room and elevated temperatures. In sharp contrast to the previous understanding that facile anion rotation primarily facilitates cation transport, the strong coupling between anion translation and vibration with cation diffusion has been unraveled for the first time; we find that translation, rotation, and vibration can each directly drive superionicity, with one typically dominant in each class of materials. Anion rotation dominates cation transport when the rotation frequency matches the cation hopping frequency, whereas anion translation prevails at higher and vibration at lower rotation frequencies. The impact of anion dynamics on cation diffusion becomes more prominent at lower temperatures.

Abstract: We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the R\'enyi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting analytical arguments for the former and devising a Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.

Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.

Abstract: We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.

Abstract: Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation resources.Here, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.

Abstract: Tensor networks developed in the context of condensed matter physics try to approximate order-$N$ tensors with a reduced number of degrees of freedom that is only polynomial in $N$ and arranged as a network of partially contracted smaller tensors. As we have recently demonstrated in the context of quantum many-body physics, computation costs can be further substantially reduced by imposing constraints on the canonical polyadic (CP) rank of the tensors in such networks [arXiv:2205.15296]. Here, we demonstrate how tree tensor networks (TTN) with CP rank constraints and tensor dropout can be used in machine learning. The approach is found to outperform other tensor-network-based methods in Fashion-MNIST image classification. A low-rank TTN classifier with branching ratio $b=4$ reaches a test set accuracy of 90.3\% with low computation costs. Consisting of mostly linear elements, tensor network classifiers avoid the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. The CP rank constraints have additional advantages: The number of parameters can be decreased and tuned more freely to control overfitting, improve generalization properties, and reduce computation costs. They allow us to employ trees with large branching ratios, substantially improving the representation power.

**Authors:** Thomas Schuster, Jonas Haferkamp, Hsin-Yuan Huang

arXiv:2407.07754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly}(\log \log n)$ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly}(\log n)$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing PRU constructions. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.

Both models are formulated in terms of linear inelastic Boltzmann-type equations, of which we investigate the main analytical properties - existence and uniqueness of solutions, trend to equilibrium, identification of the equilibrium distributions - by employing extensively Fourier methods for kinetic equations. We also provide evidence of the analytical results by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations.

arXiv:2501.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a conventional means to analyze the system mechanism based on partial differential equations (PDE) or nonlinear dynamics, iterative algorithms are computationally intensive. In this framework, the details of oscillating dynamics of cavity solitons are beyond the reach of traditional mathematical analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that this long-standing challenge could be tackled down with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. We propose the incorporating parameter-fed ports, which are capable of recognizing period-doubling bifurcations of respiratory solitons and quickly predicting nonlinear dynamics of solitons with arbitrary parameter combinations and arbitrary time series lengths. The model predictions capture oscillatory features with a small Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) = 0.01676 and an absolute error that barely grows with the length of the prediction time. Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) based parameter space boundaries for typical oscillatory patterns are plotted at about 120 times the speed relative to the split-step Fourier method (SSFM) and higher resolution.

# Learning when to rank: Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons

**Authors:** Sebastian Morel-Balbi, Alec Kirkley

arXiv:2501.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common task arising in various domains is that of ranking items based on the outcomes of pairwise comparisons, from ranking players and teams in sports to ranking products or brands in marketing studies and recommendation systems. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model of the comparison outcomes, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle the task of ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, existing inference-based ranking methods overwhelmingly choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we address this problem by developing a principled Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings -- rankings with ties -- that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. Our framework is adaptable to any statistical ranking method in which the outcomes of pairwise observations depend on the ranks or scores of the items being compared. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.

# LWFNet: Coherent Doppler Wind Lidar-Based Network for Wind Field Retrieval

## LWFNet: 基于相干多普勒测风激光雷达的风场反演网络

Abstract: Accurate detection of wind fields within the troposphere is essential for atmospheric dynamics research and plays a crucial role in extreme weather forecasting. Coherent Doppler wind lidar (CDWL) is widely regarded as the most suitable technique for high spatial and temporal resolution wind field detection. However, since coherent detection relies heavily on the concentration of aerosol particles, which cause Mie scattering, the received backscattering lidar signal exhibits significantly low intensity at high altitudes. As a result, conventional methods, such as spectral centroid estimation, often fail to produce credible and accurate wind retrieval results in these regions. To address this issue, we propose LWFNet, the first Lidar-based Wind Field (WF) retrieval neural Network, built upon Transformer and the Kolmogorov-Arnold network. Our model is trained solely on targets derived from the traditional wind retrieval algorithm and utilizes radiosonde measurements as the ground truth for test results evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that LWFNet not only extends the maximum wind field detection range but also produces more accurate results, exhibiting a level of precision that surpasses the labeled targets. This phenomenon, which we refer to as super-accuracy, is explored by investigating the potential underlying factors that contribute to this intriguing occurrence. In addition, we compare the performance of LWFNet with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, highlighting its superior effectiveness and capability in high-resolution wind retrieval. LWFNet demonstrates remarkable performance in lidar-based wind field retrieval, setting a benchmark for future research and advancing the development of deep learning models in this domain.

Abstract: A low-dimensional representation of thermochemical scalars based on cokurtosis principal component analysis (CoK-PCA) has been shown to effectively capture stiff chemical dynamics in reacting flows relative to the widely used principal component analysis (PCA). The effectiveness of the reduced manifold was evaluated in a priori analyses using both linear and nonlinear reconstructions of thermochemical scalars from aggressively truncated principal components (PCs). In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of a CoK-PCA-based reduced manifold using a posteriori analysis. Simulations of spontaneous ignition in a homogeneous reactor that pose a challenge in accurately capturing the ignition delay time as well as the scalar profiles within the reaction zone are considered. The governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in the PC space were evolved from the initial conditions using two ODE solvers. First, a standard ODE solver that uses a pre-trained artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the source terms and integrates the solution in time. Second, a neural ODE solver that incorporates the time integration of PCs into the ANN training. The time-evolved profiles of the PCs and reconstructed thermochemical scalars demonstrate the robustness of the CoK-PCA-based low-dimensional manifold in accurately capturing the ignition process. Furthermore, we observed that the neural ODE solver minimized propagation errors across time steps and provided more accurate results than the standard ODE solver. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of CoK-PCA-based manifolds to be implemented in massively parallel reacting flow solvers.

Abstract: The rising energy demands of conventional AI systems underscore the need for efficient computing technologies like brain-inspired computing. Physical reservoir computing (PRC), leveraging the nonlinear dynamics of physical systems for information processing, has emerged as a promising approach for neuromorphic computing. However, current PRC systems are constrained by narrow operating timescales and limited performance. To address these challenges, an ion-gel/graphene electric double layer transistor-based ion-gating reservoir (IGR) was developed, offering adaptability across multi-time scales with an exceptionally wide operating range from 1 MHz to 20 Hz and high information processing capacity. The IGR achieved deep learning (DL)-level accuracy in chaotic time series prediction tasks while reducing computational resource requirements to 1/100 of those needed by DL. Principal component analysis reveals the IGR's superior performance stems from its high-dimensionality, driven by the ambipolar behavior of graphene and multiple relaxation processes. The proposed IGR represents a significant step forward in providing low-power, high-performance computing solutions, particularly for resource-constrained edge environments.

**Authors:** Yee Chun Tsoi, Yu Ting Kwok, Ming Chun Lam, Wai Kin Wong

arXiv:2501.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Hong Kong Observatory, the Analogue Forecast System (AFS) for precipitation has been providing useful reference in predicting possible daily rainfall scenarios for the next 9 days, by identifying historical cases with similar weather patterns to the latest output from the deterministic model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Recent advances in machine learning allow more sophisticated models to be trained using historical data and the patterns of high-impact weather events to be represented more effectively. As such, an enhanced AFS has been developed using the deep learning technique autoencoder. The datasets of the fifth generation of the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA5) are utilised where more meteorological elements in higher horizontal, vertical and temporal resolutions are available as compared to the previous ECMWF reanalysis products used in the existing AFS. The enhanced AFS features four major steps in generating the daily rain class forecasts: (1) preprocessing of gridded ERA5 and ECMWF model forecast, (2) feature extraction by the pretrained autoencoder, (3) application of optimised feature weightings based on historical cases, and (4) calculation of the final rain class from a weighted ensemble of top analogues. The enhanced AFS demonstrates a consistent and superior performance over the existing AFS, especially in capturing heavy rain cases, during the verification period from 2019 to 2022. This paper presents the detailed formulation of the enhanced AFS and discusses its advantages and limitations in supporting precipitation forecasting in Hong Kong.

# Slim multi-scale convolutional autoencoder-based reduced-order models for interpretable features of a complex dynamical system

## 基于Slim多尺度卷积自动编码器的降阶模型，用于复杂动力系统的可解释特征

**Authors:** Philipp Teutsch, Philipp Pfeffer, Mohammad Sharifi Ghazijahani, Christian Cierpka, J\"org Schumacher, Patrick M\"ader

arXiv:2501.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, data-driven deep learning models have gained significant interest in the analysis of turbulent dynamical systems. Within the context of reduced-order models (ROMs), convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) pose a universally applicable alternative to conventional approaches. They can learn nonlinear transformations directly from data, without prior knowledge of the system. However, the features generated by such models lack interpretability. Thus, the resulting model is a black-box which effectively reduces the complexity of the system, but does not provide insights into the meaning of the latent features. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel interpretable CAE approach for high-dimensional fluid flow data that maintains the reconstruction quality of conventional CAEs and allows for feature interpretation. Our method can be easily integrated into any existing CAE architecture with minor modifications of the training process. We compare our approach to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two existing methods for interpretable CAEs. We apply all methods to three different experimental turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection datasets with varying complexity. Our results show that the proposed method is lightweight, easy to train, and achieves relative reconstruction performance improvements of up to 6.4% over POD for 64 modes. The relative improvement increases to up to 229.8% as the number of modes decreases. Additionally, our method delivers interpretable features similar to those of POD and is significantly less resource-intensive than existing CAE approaches, using less than 2% of the parameters. These approaches either trade interpretability for reconstruction performance or only provide interpretability to a limited extend.

arXiv:2501.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental Education (EE) is vital for shaping citizens who understand and value sustainability as an epistemological and practical alternative to mitigate current environmental issues. This research was prompted by the exploration of the relationship between EE and the physical sciences, connections that are often overlooked in curriculums and in the teaching processes of both this science and EE. It is essential to emphasize that physics provides conceptual frameworks and methodological tools that can enhance the understanding of environmental phenomena from a broad and multidimensional perspective. To delve into these connections, a study with a hermeneutic interpretative nuance was conducted. Through a questionnaire, the perceptions of prospective teachers in the natural sciences field regarding this topic were gathered. The findings revealed that a significant number of them recognize and value the correlation between physics and EE. From their perspective, this linkage is not only crucial for a comprehensive view of environmental dynamics but also to encourage students to develop critical, articulated, and well-founded thinking about environmental balance. The research also highlighted the didactic opportunities presented when intertwining physics with EE. By associating physical concepts with real environmental issues, learning can be reinforced, making it meaningful and enduring over time. This interdisciplinary fusion also holds the potential to increase students' motivation and interest, fostering a more active and engaged attitude in their educational journey

# Detecting and Mitigating Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning-Based MRI Reconstruction Without Any Retraining

## 检测和缓解基于深度学习的MRI重建的对抗性攻击，无需任何重新训练

**Authors:** Mahdi Saberi, Chi Zhang, Mehmet Akcakaya

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods, especially those based on physics-driven DL, have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Our detection strategy is based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency. The output of the model is mapped to another set of MRI measurements for a different sub-sampling pattern, and this synthesized data is reconstructed with the same model. Intuitively, without an attack, the second reconstruction is expected to be consistent with the first, while with an attack, disruptions are present. Subsequently, this idea is extended to devise a novel objective function, which is minimized within a small ball around the attack input for mitigation. Experimental results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining.

Abstract: Although generative models hold promise for discovering molecules with optimized desired properties, they often fail to suggest synthesizable molecules that improve upon the known molecules seen in training. We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.

arXiv:2501.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against three generative models: a variational autoencoder, a large language model, and a diffusion model. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although many of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability rate. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery.

Abstract: In solid-state materials science, substantial efforts have been devoted to the calculation and modeling of the electronic band gap. While a wide range of ab initio methods and machine learning algorithms have been created that can predict this quantity, the development of new computational approaches for studying the band gap remains an active area of research. Here we introduce a simple machine learning model for predicting the band gap using only the chemical composition of the crystalline material. To motivate the form of the model, we first analyze the empirical distribution of the band gap, which sheds new light on its atypical statistics. Specifically, our analysis enables us to frame band gap prediction as a task of modeling a mixed random variable, and we design our model accordingly. Our model formulation incorporates thematic ideas from chemical heuristic models for other material properties in a manner that is suited towards the band gap modeling task. The model has exactly one parameter corresponding to each element, which is fit using data. To predict the band gap for a given material, the model computes a weighted average of the parameters associated with its constituent elements and then takes the maximum of this quantity and zero. The model provides heuristic chemical interpretability by intuitively capturing the associations between the band gap and individual chemical elements.

Abstract: Solar wind is frequently categorized based on its respective solar source region. Two well-established categorizations of the coronal hole wind, the scheme based on the charge-state composition, and the scheme based on proton plasma, identify a very different fraction of solar wind in the data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum at the end of solar cycle 24. We investigate possible explanations for the different identifications of the coronal wind in 2009 in the scheme based on the charge-state composition (almost only coronal hole wind) and in the scheme based on the proton plasma (almost no coronal hole wind at the same time). We compared the properties of the respective coronal hole wind types and their changes with solar activity cycle in 2001- 2010. As a comparison reference, we included the coronal hole wind as identified by an unsupervised machine-learning approach, k-means, in our analysis. We find that the scheme based on charge-state composition likely misidentifies some slow solar wind as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum. The k-means classification we considered includes two types of coronal hole wind, the first of which is dominant during the solar activity maximum, whereas the second is dominant during the solar activity minimum. A low fraction of coronal hole wind from low-latitude coronal holes observed by ACE in 2009 is plausible because during this time period, a very small number of low-latitude coronal holes was observed. The results imply that the origin-oriented solar wind classification needs to be revisited, and they also suggest that an explicit inclusion of the phase of the solar activity cycle can be expected to improve the classification of the solar wind.

Abstract: We develop an artificial neural network model to predict quantum heat engines working within the experimentally realized framework of electromagnetically induced transparency. We specifically focus on {\Lambda}-type alkali-based cold atomic systems. This network allows us to analyze all the alkali atom-based engines' performance. High performance engines are predicted and analyzed based on three figures of merit output, radiation temperature, work and ergotropy. Contrary to traditional notion, the algorithm reveal the limitations of output radiation temperature as a stand alone metric for enhanced engine performance. In high output temperature regime, Cs based engine with a higher output temperature than Rb based engine is characterized by lower work and ergotropy. This is found to be true for different atomic engines with common predicted states in both high and low output temperature regimes. Additionally, the ergotropy is found to exhibit a saturating exponential dependency on the control Rabi frequency.

Abstract: The nEDM experiment at the SNS (nEDM@SNS) is the first measurement of the neutron EDM to directly measure the precession frequency of the neutron spin due to magnetic and electric fields. Previous measurements have inferred the precession frequency by measuring the residual polarization of neutrons after a long period of free precession. This difference provides independent information on potential unknown systematic uncertainties compared to previous and on-going measurements. It is precisely because nEDM@SNS is using a number of novel techniques, that it is essential to perform detailed studies of these techniques in order to optimize the statistical sensitivity and minimize the systematic uncertainty. The Systematic and Operational Studies Apparatus (SOSA) was one of the main efforts of nEDM@SNS collaboration, concentrated on development of a cryogenic test-bed for learning precise manipulation of spins and studing systematic effects of the proposed new technique. The test bed does not need an electric field but designed to have full NMR capability to the same level as nEDM@SNS.

Abstract: Identifying tropical cyclones that generate destructive storm tides for risk assessment, such as from large downscaled storm catalogs for climate studies, is often intractable because it entails many expensive Monte Carlo hydrodynamic simulations. Here, we show that surrogate models are promising from accuracy, recall, and precision perspectives, and they "generalize" to novel climate scenarios. We then present an informative online learning approach to rapidly search for extreme storm tide-producing cyclones using only a few hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a minimal subset of TCs with detailed storm tide hydrodynamic simulations, a surrogate model selects informative data to retrain online and iteratively improves its predictions of damaging TCs. Results on an extensive catalog of downscaled TCs indicate 100% precision in retrieving rare destructive storms using less than 20% of the simulations as training. The informative sampling approach is efficient, scalable to large storm catalogs, and generalizable to climate scenarios.

Abstract: Compact symbolic expressions have been shown to be more efficient than neural network models in terms of resource consumption and inference speed when implemented on custom hardware such as FPGAs, while maintaining comparable accuracy~\cite{tsoi2023symbolic}. These capabilities are highly valuable in environments with stringent computational resource constraints, such as high-energy physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. However, finding compact expressions for high-dimensional datasets remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of genetic programming, the search algorithm of most symbolic regression methods. Contrary to genetic programming, the neural network approach to symbolic regression offers scalability to high-dimensional inputs and leverages gradient methods for faster equation searching. Common ways of constraining expression complexity often involve multistage pruning with fine-tuning, which can result in significant performance loss. In this work, we propose $\tt{SymbolNet}$, a neural network approach to symbolic regression specifically designed as a model compression technique, aimed at enabling low-latency inference for high-dimensional inputs on custom hardware such as FPGAs. This framework allows dynamic pruning of model weights, input features, and mathematical operators in a single training process, where both training loss and expression complexity are optimized simultaneously. We introduce a sparsity regularization term for each pruning type, which can adaptively adjust its strength, leading to convergence at a target sparsity ratio. Unlike most existing symbolic regression methods that struggle with datasets containing more than $\mathcal{O}(10)$ inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the LHC jet tagging task (16 inputs), MNIST (784 inputs), and SVHN (3072 inputs).

Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.

Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts. In this work, we develop a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth. We focuse on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for 2010 to 2019. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model to the current solar cycle 25 in an operational setting, resulting in an RMSE of 80.3 km/s and an HSS peak velocity RMSE of 92.2 km/s. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks and MHD simulations. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities, aggravates operational space weather forecasts, and how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.

Abstract: The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Additionally, quantum circuits effectively replace MLPs by inherently preserving symmetries, with Lorentz symmetry integration ensuring robust handling of relativistic invariance. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved 74.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 87.38% on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached 67.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 68.20%, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving 88.10% and 74.80% test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.

Abstract: Background and Purpose: Accurate motion tracking in MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is essential for effective treatment delivery. This study aimed to enhance motion tracking precision in MRIgRT through an automatic real-time markerless tracking method using an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework with automatic segmentation. Materials and Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking and segmentation method by integrating the ETLD framework with an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The ETLD framework was upgraded for real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. ICV was used for precise target volume coverage, refining the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. The method was tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases. Results: Evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions showed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects in the Beam Eye View(BEV)/Beam Path View(BPV) orientation. The ETLD+ICV method achieved a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time markerless motion tracking method for MRIgRT that significantly outperforms current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also shows enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, making it an indispensable asset in improving the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.

Abstract: The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant, approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence. To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows, where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/k-flouris/gfe}.}

Abstract: Fluid simulation is an important research topic in computer graphics (CG) and animation in video games. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for efficient and robust fluid simulation in complex environments. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. We conducted comprehensive experiments on datasets. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.

Abstract: Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation resources.Here, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.

# Identifying Cognitive Resources in a Decision-Making during Gambling

## 在赌博过程中识别决策中的认知资源

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5754204/latest

In the learning stage of reward processing, the presence of an event-related potential (ERP) denoted as the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) is vastly mentioned which is elicited 200&amp;ndash;350 milliseconds after feedback onset. Previous studies have confirmed Reinforcement Learning theory's prediction that a significant correlation exists between dopamine neuron responses (which generate the FRN) and the disparity between actual and expected outcomes where the expected outcome is determined by the probability and magnitude of rewards. Although previous studies have extensively illustrated the impact of reward probability on the FRN, the demonstration of the impact of reward magnitude on the FRN has not been established conclusively and still remains a matter of debate. Here in this study, we wanted to assess the effects that reward magnitude has on the FRN and its generator(s) as well in an isolated context.  We recruited 24 participants and recorded 65-channel High-Density EEG signals with simultaneous fMRI, while they engaged in a modified task designed to control reward probability and evaluate the effects of reward magnitude. In our findings, firstly, a substantial positive correlation is observed between the ERP amplitude within the temporal window of FRN and the magnitude of outcomes, and through dipole fitting and distributed source localization, the source of FRN, regardless of magnitude, was located in the Medial Frontal Cortex. Our findings reveal strong connections among brain regions involved in error monitoring, memory, attention, and visual processing, with the dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex serving as a central hub. No significant differences were found between connectivity of win- and loss-related FRN&amp;rsquo;s brain sources. Additionally, participants demonstrated varying risk-taking behaviors across trials, favoring higher-risk options and transitioning towards more cautious decisions over consecutive trials during the experiment. The analysis also revealed increased risk-taking following losses compared to gains, highlighting contextual influences on decision-making.

## SurFF: 金属间晶体表面暴露和可合成性的通用模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4863775/latest

Catalysts are crucial in industrial processes, significantly enhancing reaction efficiency. With approximately 90% of industrial reactions occurring on surfaces, the role of heterogeneous catalysts is paramount. Accurate surface exposure prediction is vital for heterogeneous catalyst design but is hindered by the high costs of experimental and computational methods. Here, we introduce a universal force field-based model for predicting surface exposure and synthesizability (SurFF) across intermetallic crystals, essential materials for heterogeneous catalysts. We created a comprehensive intermetallic surface database using a data-efficient active learning method and high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, encompassing 12,553 unique surfaces and 344,200 single points. SurFF achieves DFT-level precision with a prediction error of 3.0 meV/&amp;Aring;&amp;sup2; and enables large-scale surface exposure prediction, an impractical task for DFT methods, through a 105-fold acceleration. Validation against computational and experimental data both shows strong alignment. We applied SurFF for large-scale predictions on over 6,000 intermetallic crystals, providing valuable data for the community. Demonstrating transferability to diverse crystal properties, SurFF is a robust tool for advancing catalyst design, representing a significant step toward large-scale catalyst discovery models.

# Maize Disease Detection using Deep Learning Models

## 基于深度学习模型的玉米病害检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5763601/latest

Disease attacks on crops like maize pose a significant threat to the global food supply chain in Africa, particularly in West Africa. Maize is a staple food source and the economic backbone of the population and farmers in West Africa. In recent years, maize yields have declined due to diseases. Systematic solutions, such as visual inspection through laboratory experiments for disease diagnosis, have not led to a significant improvement in production or ensured sustainable food security in Africa. In response to this challenge, we introduce a lightweight deep-learning ensemble model for early disease detection in maize plants. The study focuses on developing and validating a model specifically designed to identify and classify diseases in maize plants. We use computer vision technology to capture intricate patterns in maize leaf images. The model is trained to recognise six classes, with five representing different diseases and one representing a healthy state. In this paper, we explore the amalgamation of Residual Network (ResNet9) and Efficient-Net-b4 (ENetb4) as a pre-training &amp;nbsp;model built on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to improve accuracy and robustness in maize disease detection and prediction. The results of the study indicate significant opportunities for improvement in agricultural technology in West Africa. For instance, the ResNet9 model accurately identified diseased images of maize crops with a performance accuracy of 98.2%, while the (ENetb4) model achieved a performance accuracy of 94.3% in the same task.

## 预测肝硬化患者的水肿: 多变量机器学习模型的开发和验证

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5739268/latest

Purpose: Edema is a medical condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of fluid within body tissues, commonly affecting the extremities, such as legs and arms. It is a common complication of liver cirrhosis, a disease characterized by fibrosis and impaired liver function. Although edema may not pose an immediate threat to life, managing it is essential for reducing patient discomfort, keeping track of cirrhosis progression, and avoiding further complications. This study aims to construct machine learning models to predict the likelihood of edema in liver cirrhosis patients.&amp;nbsp;
Methods: This research uses data from a Mayo Clinic trial on primary biliary cirrhosis (1974-1984) with 424 patients. Eight classification algorithms&mdash;logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machine, random forests, neural networks, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and k-nearest neighbors&mdash;were evaluated for predicting the probability of edema. Correlations between the decisive attributes were also analyzed. Risk stratification was performed based on predicted probabilities from the top performing model.&amp;nbsp;
Results: Random Forest with 10-fold cross validation, exhibited better performance(accuracy &amp;gt; 90%) in identifying potential edema (precision &amp;gt; 80%), whereas neural network and logistic regression showcased better sensitivity (&amp;gt; 81%).&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion: Random forest model is the most suitable model to identify potential edema in cirrhosis patients. Such a system can help physicians to mitigate the risk of fluid imbalance early on.

# Predicting Air Quality Index in Accra using Machine Learning

## 使用机器学习预测阿克拉的空气质量指数

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5774869/latest

Air quality is a significant public health issue, and accurate predictions of the Air Quality Index (AQI) are crucial for timely interventions. This study explores the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to forecast AQI across different neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana. Six models &amp;nbsp;including Random Forest , CatBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regressions, were evaluated. Data from the Breathe Accra platform, encompassing pollutants and weather conditions in five neighborhoods, were preprocessed through data cleaning, feature selection, and normalization. Model performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). While the initial performance of the models was less satisfactory, the incorporation of wavelet transform preprocessing significantly enhanced the results. This improvement was particularly notable for the area of Korle Bu, where the CatBoost model's R2 increased from 0.32 to 0.58, RMSE decreased from 29.03 to 22.79, and MAE dropped from 22.11 to 17.01. On average, all models except SVR performed well across all areas, as evidenced by the evaluation metrics. These findings have direct implications for enhancing air quality management and policymaking in the city of Accra, where accurate AQI predictions are vital for effective public health interventions and environmental planning.

# An integrated data analysis and computational approach to reveal gene signatures for paediatric Tuberculosis meningitis related to non-tuberculosis patients

## 一种综合数据分析和计算方法来揭示与非结核病患者相关的小儿结核性脑膜炎的基因特征

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5749040/latest

The global disease burden remains greatly influenced by tuberculosis. Its most critical form, Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) affects both adults and children who face high rates of mortality and morbidity. As many as 50% of paediatric TBM cases lead to mortality, and nearly 53.9 percent of those who survive endure neurological consequences. The primary reasons for unsatisfactory TBM results are late diagnosis and the postponement of anti-tuberculosis therapy. Thus, improved case identification and prompt administration of effective treatments are crucial for controlling tuberculosis in children. The primary aim of this research is to identify new biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Tuberculosis meningitis in children by conducting RNA sequencing on data obtained from various samples. This research emphasizes the use of bioinformatics, machine learning, and diverse statistical methods, including the evaluation of fixed threshold values or p-values, which facilitate the identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs). Consequently, three new biomarkers were identified by combining the findings from RNASeq and machine learning, utilizing algorithms like multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) to suggest the optimal model with high accuracy and performance for the identification of the new biomarkers. It was understood that the RF model surpassed the other classifiers by achieving an accuracy score of 1.0 in identifying new biomarkers of Tuberculosis meningitis in children. Then computational analysis of these genes was done with the potential drugs used for treating Tuberculosis meningitis using AutodockTools software.

Farming-driven economies such as Ghana are faced with challenges due to plant diseases. Cacao, a vital crop in Ghana is severely impacted with diseases which affect its yield and decrease exports revenue through reduced exports. Leveraging deep learning techniques offers an effective solution for early detection of diseases in cacao plants. This study adopts a comprehensive approach, starting with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset containing images of both healthy and diseased cacao plants from Ghanaian farms. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we can identify patterns and understand the characteristics of the dataset, laying a solid foundation for developing robust machine learning models tailored to the specific challenges faced by Ghanaian cacao farmers. Our approach involves developing and evaluating deep learning models to detect and classify cacao plant diseases. These models are designed with the Predictability, Compatibility, and Stability (PCS) framework in mind, ensuring reliability and effectiveness in disease detection. The custom convolution neural network (CNN) model outperformed other models considered in experimental analysis. This study aims to revolutionize cacao farming through precise, stable, and ethical deep learning solutions, ultimately enhancing crop resilience, productivity, and the livelihood of Ghanaian farmers.
