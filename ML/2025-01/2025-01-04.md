# Efficient training of machine learning potentials for metallic glasses: CuZrAl validation

Abstract: Interatomic potentials play a vital role in revealing microscopic details and structure-property relations, which are fundamental for multiscale simulations and to assist high-throughput experiments. For metallic glasses, developing these potentials is challenging due to the complexity of their unique disordered structure. As a result, chemistry-specific interaction potentials for this important class of materials are often missing. Here, we solve this gap by implementing an efficient methodology for designing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for metallic glasses, and we benchmark it with the widely studied CuZrAl system. By combining a Lennard-Jones surrogate model with swap-Monte Carlo sampling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) corrections, we capture diverse amorphous structures from 14 decades of supercooling. These distinct structures provide robust and efficient training of the model and applicability to the wider spectrum of energies. This approach reduces the need for extensive DFT and ab initio optimization datasets, while maintaining high accuracy. Our MLIP shows results comparable to the classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) available for CuZrAl, in predicting structural, energetic, and mechanical properties. This work paves the way for the development of new MLIPs for complex metallic glasses, including emerging multicomponent and high entropy metallic glasses.

# Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals

**Authors:** Sarah I. Allec, Maxim Ziatdinov

arXiv:2501.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.

arXiv:2501.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.

Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.

# Integrative Learning of Intensity Fluctuations of Quantum Dots under Excitation via a Tailored Mixture Hidden Markov Model

Abstract: Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant interest in various scientific fields due to their unique fluorescence properties. One captivating characteristic of QDs is their ability to emit photons under continuous excitation. The intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different dots even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. As such, conventional approaches in the chemistry literature, typified by single-dot analysis of raw intensity data with Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM), cannot meet the many analytical challenges and may fail to capture any novel yet rare fluctuation patterns among QDs. Collaborating with scientists in the chemistry field, we have developed an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series of multiple QDs. Our approach still inherits the HMM as the skeleton to model the intensity fluctuations of each dot, and based on the data structure and the hypothesized collective behaviors of the QDs, our approach asserts that (i) under each hidden state, the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, (ii) the state distributions are shared across all the QDs, and (iii) the patterns of transitions can vary across QDs. These unique features allow for a precise characterization of the intensity fluctuation patterns and facilitate the clustering of the QDs. With experimental data collected on 128 QDs, our methods reveal several QD clusters characterized by unique transition patterns across three intensity states. The results provide deeper insight into QD behaviors and their design/application potentials.

Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.

Abstract: Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.

# Connecting NTK and NNGP: A Unified Theoretical Framework for Wide Neural Network Learning Dynamics

arXiv:2309.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.

**Authors:** Matt Raymond, Paolo Elvati, Jacob C. Saldinger, Jonathan Lin, Xuetao Shi, Angela Violi

arXiv:2501.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) formed in nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) can have unique properties and applications. However, modeling their growth in these environments presents significant challenges due to the non-equilibrium nature of NTPs, making them computationally expensive to describe. In this work, we address the challenges associated with accelerating the estimation of parameters needed for these models. Specifically, we explore how different machine learning models can be tailored to improve prediction outcomes. We apply these methods to reactive classical molecular dynamics data, which capture the processes associated with colliding silane fragments in NTPs. These reactions exemplify processes where qualitative trends are clear, but their quantification is challenging, hard to generalize, and requires time-consuming simulations. Our results demonstrate that good prediction performance can be achieved when appropriate loss functions are implemented and correct invariances are imposed. While the diversity of molecules used in the training set is critical for accurate prediction, our findings indicate that only a fraction (15-25\%) of the energy and temperature sampling is required to achieve high levels of accuracy. This suggests a substantial reduction in computational effort is possible for similar systems.

Abstract: Generating an accurate solution of the Navier--Stokes equations using physics--informed neural networks (PINNs) for higher Reynolds numbers in the corners of a lid--driven cavity problem is challenging. In this paper, we improve the solution accuracy of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the region near the walls significantly and generate accurate secondary vortices in the corners of the lid--driven cavity by solving the governing equations using finite difference--based PINNs (FD--PINNs) without employing the known solution. We adopt the domain decomposition method (DDM) and combine it with the FD--PINNs to solve the lid--driven cavity problem for the Reynolds numbers Re = 400 and Re=1000. A comparison of the mean square error (MSE) between the presented and standard FD--PINNs using the reference solution is exhibited, showing the accuracy and effectiveness of the new approach.

Abstract: (Pseudo)random sampling, a costly yet widely used method in (probabilistic) machine learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, remains unfeasible on a truly large scale due to unmet computational requirements. We introduce an energy-efficient algorithm for uniform Float16 sampling, utilizing a room-temperature stochastic magnetic tunnel junction device to generate truly random floating-point numbers. By avoiding expensive symbolic computation and mapping physical phenomena directly to the statistical properties of the floating-point format and uniform distribution, our approach achieves a higher level of energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art Mersenne-Twister algorithm by a minimum factor of 9721 and an improvement factor of 5649 compared to the more energy-efficient PCG algorithm. Building on this sampling technique and hardware framework, we decompose arbitrary distributions into many non-overlapping approximative uniform distributions along with convolution and prior-likelihood operations, which allows us to sample from any 1D distribution without closed-form solutions. We provide measurements of the potential accumulated approximation errors, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Phase-field modeling reformulates fracture problems as energy minimization problems and enables a comprehensive characterization of the fracture process, including crack nucleation, propagation, merging, and branching, without relying on ad-hoc assumptions. However, the numerical solution of phase-field fracture problems is characterized by a high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we employ a deep neural operator (DeepONet) consisting of a branch network and a trunk network to solve brittle fracture problems. We explore three distinct approaches that vary in their trunk network configurations. In the first approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a two-step DeepONet, which results in a simplification of the learning task. In the second approach, we employ a physics-informed DeepONet, whereby the mathematical expression of the energy is integrated into the trunk network's loss to enforce physical consistency. The integration of physics also results in a substantially smaller data size needed for training. In the third approach, we replace the neural network in the trunk with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and train it without the physics loss. Using these methods, we model crack nucleation in a one-dimensional homogeneous bar under prescribed end displacements, as well as crack propagation and branching in single edge-notched specimens with varying notch lengths subjected to tensile and shear loading. We show that the networks predict the solution fields accurately, and the error in the predicted fields is localized near the crack.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.

arXiv:2501.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying tropical cyclones that generate destructive storm tides for risk assessment, such as from large downscaled storm catalogs for climate studies, is often intractable because it entails many expensive Monte Carlo hydrodynamic simulations. Here, we show that surrogate models are promising from accuracy, recall, and precision perspectives, and they ``generalize" to novel climate scenarios. We then present an informative online learning approach to rapidly search for extreme storm tide-producing cyclones using only a few hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a minimal subset of TCs with detailed storm tide hydrodynamic simulations, a surrogate model selects informative data to retrain online and iteratively improves its predictions of damaging TCs. Results on an extensive catalog of downscaled TCs indicate a 100% precision retrieving the rare destructive storms training using less than 20% of the simulations as training. The informative sampling approach is efficient, scalable to large storm catalogs, and generalizable to climate scenarios.

Abstract: This research employs Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) alongside differentiable physics to model viscoelastic fluids, merging conventional differential equations, neural networks and numerical methods to reconstruct missing terms in constitutive models. This study focuses on analyzing four viscoelastic models: Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM), Johnson-Segalman, Giesekus, and Exponential Phan-Thien-Tanner (ePTT), through the use of synthetic datasets. The methodology was tested across different experimental conditions, including oscillatory and startup flows. While the UDE framework effectively predicts shear and normal stresses for most models, it demonstrates some limitations when applied to the ePTT model. The findings underscore the potential of UDEs in fluid mechanics while identifying critical areas for methodological improvement. Also, a model distillation approach was employed to extract simplified models from complex ones, emphasizing the versatility and robustness of UDEs in rheological modeling.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive numerical analysis of a quantum-dot-engineered heterostructure, PbS:$Yb^{3+},Er^{3+}$/CuBiO, optimized for water splitting applications. Using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with machine learning, the study explores the electronic, optical, and catalytic properties of the material. The optimized PbS structure exhibited a direct bandgap of 1.191 eV, while co-doping with Yb and Er transitioned the material to a metallic state, enhancing charge carrier mobility and electron-hole separation. The final heterostructure displayed an indirect bandgap of 0.431 eV, favorable for visible-light absorption. Key findings include an internal electric field strength of 6.3 Debye, efficient charge transfer confirmed by Bader analysis, and strong optical absorption at 2.4 eV. Machine learning models, including DNN and LSTM, were employed to predict photon absorption rates, achieving mean squared errors as low as 0.0004. The synergistic effects of enhanced internal electric fields, optimized band structures, and strong photon absorption underscore the materials' potential for efficient hydrogen production. This study bridges advanced computational methods and machine learning, offering a framework for designing high-performance photocatalysts in renewable energy applications.

Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a sustainable pathway for hydrogen production, leveraging sunlight to drive chemical reactions. This review explores the integration of density functional theory (DFT) with machine learning (ML) to accelerate the discovery, optimization, and design of photocatalysts. DFT provides quantum-mechanical insights into electronic structures and reaction mechanisms, while ML algorithms enable high-throughput analysis of material properties, prediction of catalytic performance, and inverse design.

Key breakthroughs include the use of ML architectures such as random forests, support vector regression, and neural networks, trained on experimental and computational datasets to optimize band gaps, surface reactions, and hydrogen evolution rates. Emerging techniques like quantum machine learning (QML) and generative models (GANs, VAEs) demonstrate the potential to explore hypothetical materials and enhance computational efficiency. The review also highlights advanced light sources, such as tunable LEDs and solar simulators, for experimental validation of photocatalytic systems. Challenges related to data standardization, scalability, and interpretability are addressed, proposing collaborative frameworks and open-access repositories to democratize DFT-AI tools. By bridging experimental and computational methodologies, this synergistic approach offers transformative potential for achieving scalable, cost-effective hydrogen production, paving the way for sustainable energy solutions.

**Authors:** Alec J. Linot, Haotian Hang, Eva Kanso, Kunihiko Taira

arXiv:2501.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of collective dynamics is a challenging problem because emergent phenomena in multi-agent systems are often shaped by long-range interactions among individuals. For example, in bird flocks and fish schools, long-range vision and flow coupling drive individual behaviors across the collective. Such collective motion can be modeled using graph neural networks (GNNs), but GNNs struggle when graphs become large and often fail to capture long-range interactions. Here, we construct hierarchical and equivariant GNNs, and show that these GNNs accurately predict local and global behavior in systems with collective motion. As representative examples, we apply this approach to simulations of clusters of point vortices and populations of microswimmers. For the point vortices, we define a local graph of vortices within a cluster and a global graph of interactions between clusters. For the microswimmers, we define a local graph around each microswimmer and a global graph that groups long-range interactions. We then combine this hierarchy of graphs with an approach that enforces equivariance to rotations and translations. This combination results in a significant improvement over a fully-connected GNN. For point vortices, our method conserves the Hamiltonian over long times, and, for microswimmers, our method predicts the transition from aggregation to swirling.

**Authors:** Yangxuan Shi, Wuyue Yang, Liu Hong

arXiv:2501.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-phase method for learning interaction kernels of stochastic many-particle systems. After transforming stochastic trajectories of every particle into the particle density function by the kernel density estimation method, the first phase of our approach combines importance sampling with an adaptive threshold strategy to identify key terms in the kernel function, while the second phase uses the whole dataset to refine the coefficients. During the implementation of our method, the mean-field equation plays a key role in reformulating the task of extracting the interaction kernels into a learnable regression problem. We demonstrate the outstanding performance of our approach through extensive numerical examples, including interacting particle systems with a cubic potential, power-law repulsion-attraction potential, piecewise linear potential, as well as a two-dimensional radially symmetric potential.

arXiv:2501.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiscale and turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere has historically rendered accurate weather modeling a hard problem. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing various weather phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective weather models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension. Moreover, we develop an approach for handling terms that are not integrable-by-parts, such as advection operators.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the brain's parallel and energy-efficient processing, offers a transformative approach to artificial intelligence. In this study, we fabricated optimized spin-transfer torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) and investigated their dynamic behaviors using a hybrid excitation scheme combining AC laser illumination and DC bias currents. Laser-induced thermal gradients generate pulsed thermoelectric voltages ($V_{\text{AC}}$) via the Tunnel Magneto-Seebeck (TMS) effect, while the addition of bias currents enhances this response, producing both $V_{\text{AC}}$ and a DC component ($V_{\text{DC}}$). Magnetic field sweeps reveal distinct switching between parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetization states in both voltage components, supporting multistate memory applications. Millivolt-range thermovoltage signals in open-circuit conditions demonstrate CMOS compatibility, enabling simplified, scalable neuromorphic systems. Under biased conditions, enhanced thermovoltage outputs exhibit intriguing phenomena, including spikes correlated with Barkhausen jumps and double-switching behavior, offering insights into magnetization dynamics and vortex transitions. These features resemble neural spiking behavior, suggesting applications in spiking neural networks, reservoir computing, multistate logic, analog computing, and high-resolution sensing. By bridging spintronic phenomena with practical applications, this work provides a versatile platform for next-generation AI technologies and adaptive computing architectures.

Abstract: The dose of X-ray radiation and the scanning time are crucial factors in computed tomography (CT) for clinical applications. In this work, we introduce a multi-source static CT imaging system designed to rapidly acquire sparse view and limited angle data in CT imaging, addressing these critical factors. This linear imaging inverse problem is solved by a conditional generation process within the denoising diffusion image reconstruction framework. The noisy volume data sample generated by the reverse time diffusion process is projected onto the affine set to ensure its consistency to the measured data. To enhance the quality of the reconstruction, the 3D phantom's orthogonal space projector is parameterized implicitly by a neural network. Then, a self-supervised learning algorithm is adopted to optimize the implicit neural representation. Through this multistage conditional generation process, we obtain a new approximate posterior sampling strategy for MSCT volume reconstruction. Numerical experiments are implemented with various imaging settings to verify the effectiveness of our methods for incomplete data MSCT volume reconstruction.

# Solving all laminar flows around airfoils all-at-once using a parametric neural network solver

## 使用参数神经网络求解器一次性求解翼型周围的所有层流

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed increasing research interests of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving forward, inverse, and parametric problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their promise, PINNs still face significant challenges in many scenarios due to ill-conditioning. Time-stepping-oriented neural network (TSONN) addresses this by reformulating the ill-conditioned optimization problem into a series of well-conditioned sub-problems, greatly improving its ability to handle complex scenarios. This paper presents a new solver for laminar flow around airfoils based on TSONN and mesh transformation, validated across various test cases. Specifically, the solver achieves mean relative errors of approximately 3.6% for lift coefficients and 1.4% for drag coefficients. Furthermore, this paper extends the solver to parametric problems involving flow conditions and airfoil shapes, covering nearly all laminar flow scenarios in engineering. The shape parameter space is defined as the union of 30% perturbations applied to each airfoil in the UIUC airfoil database, with Reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 5000 and angles of attack spanning from -5{\deg} to 15{\deg}. The parametric solver solves all laminar flows within the parameter space in just 4.6 day, at approximately 40 times the computational cost of solving a single flow. The model training involves hundreds of millions of flow conditions and airfoil shapes, ultimately yielding a surrogate model with strong generalization capability that does not require labeled data. Specifically, the surrogate model achieves average errors of 4.6% for lift coefficients and 1.1% for drag coefficients, demonstrating its potential for high generalizability, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency in addressing high-dimensional parametric problems and surrogate modeling.

# Integrative Learning of Intensity Fluctuations of Quantum Dots under Excitation via a Tailored Mixture Hidden Markov Model

Abstract: Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant interest in various scientific fields due to their unique fluorescence properties. One captivating characteristic of QDs is their ability to emit photons under continuous excitation. The intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different dots even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. As such, conventional approaches in the chemistry literature, typified by single-dot analysis of raw intensity data with Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM), cannot meet the many analytical challenges and may fail to capture any novel yet rare fluctuation patterns among QDs. Collaborating with scientists in the chemistry field, we have developed an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series of multiple QDs. Our approach still inherits the HMM as the skeleton to model the intensity fluctuations of each dot, and based on the data structure and the hypothesized collective behaviors of the QDs, our approach asserts that (i) under each hidden state, the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, (ii) the state distributions are shared across all the QDs, and (iii) the patterns of transitions can vary across QDs. These unique features allow for a precise characterization of the intensity fluctuation patterns and facilitate the clustering of the QDs. With experimental data collected on 128 QDs, our methods reveal several QD clusters characterized by unique transition patterns across three intensity states. The results provide deeper insight into QD behaviors and their design/application potentials.

# Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Scatter Correction for Total-body PET

## 基于深度学习的全身PET散射校正评价

**Authors:** Baptiste Laurent, Alexandre Bousse, Thibaut Merlin, Axel Rominger, Kuangyu Shi, Dimitris Visvikis

arXiv:2501.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography (PET) systems allow higher sensitivity, with an increased number of detected lines of response induced by a larger angle of acceptance. However this extend angle increase the number of multiple scatters and the scatter contribution within oblique planes. As scattering affects both quality and quantification of the reconstructed image, it is crucial to correct this effect with more accurate methods than the state-of-the-art single scatter simulation (SSS) that can reach its limits with such an extended field-of-view (FOV). In this work, which is an extension of our previous assessment of deep learning-based scatter estimation (DLSE) carried out on a conventional PET system, we aim to evaluate the DLSE method performance on LAFOV total-body PET.
  Approach: The proposed DLSE method based on an convolutional neural network (CNN) U-Net architecture uses emission and attenuation sinograms to estimate scatter sinogram. The network was trained from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of XCAT phantoms [18F]-FDG PET acquisitions using a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner model, with multiple morphologies and dose distributions. We firstly evaluated the method performance on simulated data in both sinogram and image domain by comparing it to the MC ground truth and SSS scatter sinograms. We then tested the method on 7 [18F]-FDG and 7 [18F]-PSMA clinical datasets, and compare it to SSS estimations.
  Results: DLSE showed superior accuracy on phantom data, greater robustness to patient size and dose variations compared to SSS, and better lesion contrast recovery. It also yielded promising clinical results, improving lesion contrasts in [18 F]-FDG datasets and performing consistently with [18F]-PSMA datasets despite no training with [18F]-PSMA.

Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning involves agents that learn together in a shared environment, leading to emergent dynamics sensitive to initial conditions and parameter variations. A Dynamical Systems approach, which studies the evolution of multi-component systems over time, has uncovered some of the underlying dynamics by constructing deterministic approximation models of stochastic algorithms. In this work, we demonstrate that even in the simplest case of independent Q-learning with a Boltzmann exploration policy, significant discrepancies arise between the actual algorithm and previous approximations. We elaborate why these models actually approximate interesting variants rather than the original incremental algorithm. To explain the discrepancies, we introduce a new discrete-time approximation model that explicitly accounts for agents' update frequencies within the learning process and show that its dynamics fundamentally differ from the simplified dynamics of prior models. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by applying it to the question of spontaneous cooperation in social dilemmas, specifically the Prisoner's Dilemma as the simplest case study. We identify conditions under which the learning behaviour appears as long-term stable cooperation from an external perspective. However, our model shows that this behaviour is merely a metastable transient phase and not a true equilibrium, making it exploitable. We further exemplify how specific parameter settings can significantly exacerbate the moving target problem in independent learning. Through a systematic analysis of our model, we show that increasing the discount factor induces oscillations, preventing convergence to a joint policy. These oscillations arise from a supercritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, which transforms the unique stable fixed point into an unstable focus surrounded by a stable limit cycle.

Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.

Abstract: The application of machine learning to the study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impacts on Earth has seen significant growth recently. Understanding and forecasting CME geoeffectiveness is crucial for protecting infrastructure in space and ensuring the resilience of technological systems on Earth. Here we present GeoCME, a deep-learning framework designed to predict, deterministically or probabilistically, whether a CME event that arrives at Earth will cause a geomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm is defined as a disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere during which the minimum Dst index value is less than -50 nT. GeoCME is trained on observations from the instruments including LASCO C2, EIT and MDI on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), focusing on a dataset that includes 136 halo/partial halo CMEs in Solar Cycle 23. Using ensemble and transfer learning techniques, GeoCME is capable of extracting features hidden in the SOHO observations and making predictions based on the learned features. Our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of GeoCME, achieving a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.807 and a true skill statistics score of 0.714 when the tool is used as a deterministic prediction model. When the tool is used as a probabilistic forecasting model, it achieves a Brier score of 0.094 and a Brier skill score of 0.493. These results are promising, showing that the proposed GeoCME can help enhance our understanding of CME-triggered solar-terrestrial interactions.

Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.

Abstract: Porous media is widely distributed in nature, found in environments such as soil, rock formations, and plant tissues, and is crucial in applications like subsurface oil and gas extraction, medical drug delivery, and filtration systems. Understanding the properties of porous media, such as the permeability and formation factor, is crucial for comprehending the physics of fluid flow within them. We present a novel fusion model that significantly enhances memory efficiency compared to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Although the CNNs have been employed to estimate these properties from high-resolution, three-dimensional images of porous media, they often suffer from high memory consumption when processing large-dimensional inputs. Our model integrates a simplified CNN with a graph neural network (GNN), which efficiently consolidates clusters of pixels into graph nodes and edges that represent pores and throats, respectively. This graph-based approach aligns naturally with the porous medium structure, enabling large-scale simulations that are challenging with traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the GNN Grad-CAM technology to provide new interpretability and insights into fluid dynamics in porous media. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of the fusion model in predicting porous medium properties is superior to that of the standalone CNN, while its total parameter count is nearly two orders of magnitude lower. This innovative approach highlights the transformative potential of hybrid neural network architectures in advancing research on fluid flow in porous media.

Abstract: The effectiveness of the Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for learning the dynamics of constrained Hamiltonian systems is demonstrated using the Dirac theory of constraints for regular systems with holonomic constraints and systems with non-standard Lagrangians. By utilizing Dirac brackets, we derive the Hamilton-Dirac equations and minimize their residuals, incorporating also energy conservation and the Dirac constraints, using appropriate regularization terms in the loss function. The resulting PINNs, referred to as Hamilton-Dirac Neural Networks (HDNNs), successfully learn constrained dynamics without deviating from the constraint manifold. Two examples with holonomic constraints are presented: the nonlinear pendulum in Cartesian coordinates and a two-dimensional, elliptically restricted harmonic oscillator. In both cases, HDNNs exhibit superior performance in preserving energy and constraints compared to traditional explicit solvers. To demonstrate applicability in systems with singular Lagrangians, we computed the guiding center motion in a strong magnetic field starting from the guiding center Lagrangian. The imposition of energy conservation during the neural network training proved essential for accurately determining the orbits of the guiding center. The HDNN architecture enables the learning of parametric dependencies in constrained dynamics by incorporating a problem-specific parameter as an input, in addition to the time variable. Additionally, an example of semi-supervised, data-driven learning of guiding center dynamics with parameter inference is presented.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.

Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is among the most actively studied topics in atomic and molecular calculations on quantum computers, yet few studies address properties other than energies or account for relativistic effects. This work presents high-precision 18-qubit relativistic VQE simulations for calculating the permanent electric dipole moments (PDMs) of BeH to RaH molecules on traditional computers, and 6- and 12-qubit PDM computations for SrH on IonQ quantum devices. To achieve high precision on current noisy intermediate scale era quantum hardware, we apply various resource reduction methods, including Reinforcement Learning and causal flow preserving ZX-Calculus routines, along with error mitigation and post-selection techniques. Our approach reduces the two-qubit gate count in our 12-qubit circuit by 99.71%, with only a 2.35% trade-off in precision for PDM when evaluated classically within a suitably chosen active space. On the current generation IonQ Forte-I hardware, the error in PDM is -1.17% relative to classical calculations and only 1.21% compared to the unoptimized circuit.

Abstract: A machine-learning strategy for investigating the stability of fluid flow problems is proposed herein. The objective is to exploit shallow neural networks for a binary classification task to distinguish between bifurcated and non-bifurcated states. The goal is to provide a simple yet robust methodology to find a nonlinear mapping from the parametric space to a bifurcating indicator identifying the region of interest.The computational procedure is demonstrably robust and does not require parameter tuning. The essential feature of the strategy is that the computational solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is a reliable proxy for laboratory experiments investigating sensitivity to flow parameters. The applicability of our bifurcation detection strategy is demonstrated by an investigation of two classical examples of flow instability associated with thermal convection. The codes used to generate and process the labelled data are available on GitHub.

Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.

Abstract: Regional flow duration curves (FDCs) often reflect streamflow influenced by human activities. We propose a new machine learning algorithm to predict naturalized FDCs at human influenced sites and multiple catchment scales. Separate Meta models are developed to predict probable flow at discrete exceedance probabilities across catchments spanning multiple stream orders. Discrete exceedance flows reflect the stacking of k-fold cross-validated predictions from trained base ensemble machine learning models with and without hyperparameter tuning. The quality of individual base models reflects random stratified shuffling of spilt catchment records for training and testing. A Meta model is formed by retraining minimum variance base models that are bias corrected and used to predict final flows at selected percentiles that quantify uncertainty. Separate Meta models are developed and used to predict naturalised stochastic flows at other discrete exceedance probabilities along the duration curve. Efficacy of the new method is demonstrated for predicting naturalized stochastic FDCs at human influenced gauged catchments and ungauged stream reaches of unknown influences across Otago New Zealand. Important findings are twofold. First, independent observations of naturalised Median flows compare within few percent of the 50th percentile predictions from the FDC models. Second, the naturalised Meta models predict FDCs that outperform the calibrated SWAT model FDCs at gauge sites in the Taieri Freshwater Management Unit: Taieri at Tiroiti, Taieri at Sutton Creek, and Taieri River at Outram. Departures in the naturalised reference state are interpreted as flow regime changes across the duration curves. We believe these Meta models will be useful in predicting naturalised catchment FDCs across other New Zealand regions using physical catchment features available from the national data base.

Abstract: While autoregressive machine-learning-based emulators have been trained to produce stable and accurate rollouts in the climate of the present-day and recent past, none so far have been trained to emulate the sensitivity of climate to substantial changes in CO$_2$ or other greenhouse gases. As an initial step we couple the Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 to a slab ocean model (hereafter ACE2-SOM) and train it on output from a collection of equilibrium-climate physics-based reference simulations with varying levels of CO$_2$. We test it in equilibrium and non-equilibrium climate scenarios with CO$_2$ concentrations seen and unseen in training.
  ACE2-SOM performs well in equilibrium-climate inference with both in-sample and out-of-sample CO$_2$ concentrations, accurately reproducing the emergent time-mean spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation change with CO$_2$ doubling, tripling, or quadrupling. In addition, the vertical profile of atmospheric warming and change in extreme precipitation rates up to the 99.9999th percentile closely agree with the reference model. Non-equilibrium-climate inference is more challenging. With CO$_2$ increasing gradually at a rate of 2% year$^{-1}$, ACE2-SOM can accurately emulate the global annual mean trends of surface and lower-to-middle atmosphere fields but produces unphysical jumps in stratospheric fields. With an abrupt quadrupling of CO$_2$, ML-controlled fields transition unrealistically quickly to the 4xCO$_2$ regime. In doing so they violate global energy conservation and exhibit unphysical sensitivities of and surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes to instantaneous changes in CO$_2$. Future emulator development needed to address these issues should improve its generalizability to diverse climate change scenarios.

Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.

Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.

Here, we introduce geom2vec, in which pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs) are used as universal geometric featurizers. By pretraining equivariant GNNs on a large dataset of molecular conformations with a self-supervised denoising objective, we obtain transferable structural representations that are useful for learning conformational dynamics without further fine-tuning. We show how the learned GNN representations can capture interpretable relationships between structural units (tokens) by combining them with expressive token mixers. Importantly, decoupling training the GNNs from training for downstream tasks enables analysis of larger molecular graphs (such as small proteins at all-atom resolution) with limited computational resources. In these ways, geom2vec eliminates the need for manual feature selection and increases the robustness of simulation analyses.

# Resolving Three-Dimensional Nanoscale Heterogeneities in Lithium Metal Batteries with Cryogenic Electron Tomography

## 通过低温电子断层扫描解决锂金属电池中的三维纳米级异质性

**Authors:** Yi, Cui

Current direct observation of sensitive battery materials and interfaces primarily relies on two-dimensional (2D) imaging, leaving out their three-dimensional (3D) relationship. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the lithium metal anode in 3D at       nanometer resolution and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal atomic details in local regions. We imaged both freshly prepared and calendar aged Li metal anodes to reveal the development of LiH in Li dendrites and the Li-LiH interface, as well as the development of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). Using a convolutional neural network-based technique, the 3D arrangement of Li metal, along with nanoscale LiH and Cu heterogeneities in dendrites were visualized and annotated. In longer-term calendar aging, we observed more substantial LiH growth accompanied by extended SEI growth. Our results show that the growth of LiH and of the extended SEI during battery calendar aging are temporally and spatially separate processes

# LEGOLAS: a Machine Learning method for rapid and accurate predictions of protein NMR chemical shifts.

## LEGOLAS: 一种快速准确预测蛋白质NMR化学位移的机器学习方法。

**Authors:** Ignacio, Pickering

This work introduces LEGOLAS, a fully open source TorchANI-based neural network model designed to predict NMR chemical shifts for protein backbone atoms. LEGOLAS has been designed to be fast, and without loss of accuracy, as our model is able to predict backbone chemical shifts with root-mean-square errors of 2.69 ppm for N, 0.95 ppm for Ca, 1.40 ppm for Cb, 1.06 ppm for C’, 0.52 ppm for amide protons, and 0.29 ppm for H. The program predicts chemical shifts at least one order of magnitude faster than the widely utilized SHIFTX2 model. This breakthrough allows us to predict NMR chemical shifts for a very large number of input structures, such as frames from a molecular dynamics trajectory. In our simulation of the protein BBL from E. coli, we observe that averaging the chemical shift predictions for a set of frames of an MD trajectory substantially improves the agreement with experiment with respect of using a single frame of the dynamics. We also show that LEGOLAS can be successfully applied to the problem of recognizing the native states of a protein among a set of decoys.

# Targeted Molecular Generation With Latent Reinforcement Learning

## 具有潜在强化学习的目标分子生成

**Authors:** Govinda, Bhisetti

Computational methods for generating molecules with specific physiochemical properties or biolog- ical activity can greatly assist drug discovery efforts. Deep learning generative models constitute a significant step towards that direction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes a Reinforcement Learning paradigm, called proximal policy optimization (PPO), for optimizing chemical molecules in the latent space of a pre-trained deep learning generative model. Working in the latent space of a generative model allows us to bypass the need for explicitly defining chemical rules when computationally designing molecules. The generation of molecules with desired properties is achieved through navigating the latent space for identifying regions that correspond to molecules with desired properties. Proximal policy optimization is a state-of-the-art policy gradient algorithm capable of operating in continuous high dimensional spaces in a sample-efficient manner. We have paired our optimization framework with the latent spaces of two autoencoder models, a variational autoencoder and an autoencoder trained with mutual information machine loss respectively, showing that the method is agnostic to the underlying architecture. We present results on commonly used benchmarks for molecule optimization that demonstrate that our method has comparable or even superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches. We additionally show how our method can generate molecules that contain a pre-specified substructure while simultaneously optimizing for molecular properties, a task highly relevant to real drug discovery scenarios.

# Level of knowledge on preconception care and associated factors among healthcare providers working in public health institutions in Adama town, Oromia, Ethiopia

## 埃塞俄比亚奥罗米亚阿达玛镇公共卫生机构工作的医疗服务提供者对孕前保健和相关因素的知识水平

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5455142/latest

Background: Preconception care is the provision of biomedical, behavioral, and social health interventions to women and couples before pregnancy occurs. Preconception care is the most recently identified innovative approach among the spectrum of maternal and child health services to address all adverse pregnancy outcomes and to considerably reduce maternal, new-born, infant, and child morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the findings of this study may be used as preliminary information by concerned bodies.
Objective: The study aimed to assess the level of knowledge on preconception care and associated factors among healthcare providers working in public health facilities in Adama town, Oromia, Ethiopia, from February 01 to 28, 2022.
Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 429 health care providers selected using a multistage sampling technique. Data was collected by an interviewer-administered questioner, then entered into Epi-Info version 7.2 and exported to SPSS version 22 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was performed to describe the study population. A simple binary logistic regression analysis was performed, and variables with a p-value &amp;lt; 0.25 were selected for multivariable regression analysis. The association between dependent and independent variables was estimated by an adjusted odds ratio along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). P-value &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered to declare statistical significance.
Results: Among the total study participants, 261 (61.3%) (95% CI: 56.8%&ndash;66.2%) of healthcare providers had a good level of knowledge of preconception care. Among respondents' characteristics, the odds of having a good level of knowledge on preconception care were significantly associated with: male healthcare providers (AOR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.28&ndash;3.95); bachelor of science degree and above holders (AOR: 2.77, 95% CI: 1.4-5.52); medical doctors (AOR: 5.16, 95% CI: 1.6-16.57); midwives (AOR: 3.75, 95% CI: 1.52-9.3); urban extension workers (AOR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13-0.89); internet users (AOR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.44-5.2) and access to a national preconception care protocol (AOR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.07-3.44).
Conclusion: More than half of healthcare providers in Adama town public health facilities were knowledgeable about preconception care. Male healthcare providers, BSc degree holders, medical doctors, midwives, urban extension workers, internet users, and access to the national preconception care protocol were found to be significantly associated factors. The Regional Health Bureau and Ministry of Health should prepare comprehensive preconception care guidelines and provide learning opportunities for urban health extension workers, diploma health care providers to upgrade their education level and provide continuous pre-service and in-service training on preconception care for all health care providers.

# Identification of the Recurrence of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer by Stacking Classifier

## 利用堆叠分类器识别分化型甲状腺癌复发

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5713674/latest

The performance of different machine learning models for predicting well-differentiated thyroid cancer recurrence is compared in this study using several accuracy metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, specificity, the area under the curve (ROC), and Kappa statistics. The models that the paper considered for ranking are Logistic Regression (LR), Na&iuml;ve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), and the proposed Stacked model. The results suggest that the use of ensemble learning methods, especially the proposed Stacked model, results in a generalized improvement over individual classifiers in terms of most of the measures. From Stacked models, there was a boosted level of sensitivity, precision, and F1-score, and the AUC in the higher train-test split (such as 80-20%) and 30-fold cross-validation where the accuracy was at par 100% and consistent. Random Forest also showed good accuracy of results and increased their speed when working with large data sets. The best outcomes were achieved using Decision Trees depending on the 80-20 split and 30-fold cross-validation. However, in Naive Bayes, which was used as a baseline, all the metrics were the lowest, indicating its inapplicability to this data set. Among the ensemble models, the newly designed Stacked model is the best for prediction accuracy of thyroid cancer recurrence; Random Forest is preferred for volume datasets. The results imply that using ensemble methods of constructing classifiers and selecting training data splits are indicative of operationalizing better models in intricate classification problems.

# Effort, Mindset, and Motivation: Comparing Traditional and Machine Learning Regression Models in Predicting Math Performance

## 努力、心态和动机: 传统和机器学习回归模型在预测数学成绩中的比较

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5744169/latest

This study examines the influence of effort, growth mindset, and motivation on mathematics performance, comparing the effectiveness of traditional and machine learning regression models. Using secondary data from 4,552 students, five models&amp;mdash;multiple regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM&amp;mdash;were evaluated for predictive accuracy and feature importance. The results demonstrate that machine learning models, particularly XGBoost, significantly outperform traditional regression, with XGBoost achieving the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;7186.49) and the highest R-squared (0.1571). Effort emerged as the strongest predictor, followed by growth mindset, while motivation had a smaller but notable influence. These findings reinforce the applicability of Self-Regulation Theory and Growth Mindset Theory, highlighting the potential of machine learning to enhance educational research. Practical implications emphasize the importance of fostering effort and growth mindset through targeted interventions and leveraging predictive analytics for data-driven decision-making in education.

# Contextual factors&rsquo; Correlates on Teachers&rsquo; ICT Beliefs and their ICT use in urban slum public basic schools in Ghana

## 背景因素与加纳城市贫民窟公立基础学校教师的ICT信念及其ICT使用的相关性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5742989/latest

This study examined the implementation of Information and Communications Technology for Education (ICT4E) in public basic schools situated in urban slums in Ghana. The research focused on contextual factors, teachers' ICT beliefs, and the extent of ICT usage in these educational settings. The primary objective is to investigate the relationships between contextual factors, teachers' beliefs about ICT, and their actual use of ICT in the classroom. Data were collected from 179 randomly selected teachers through a structured questionnaire using a cross-sectional survey design. The collected data were then analyzed using IBM SPSS v.26 and Pearson's correlation coefficient to examine the associations between the variables. The results reveal a weak but statistically significant relationship between contextual factors and teachers' ICT usage, suggesting that the environmental context plays a role in ICT adoption, albeit with limited influence. The study also finds a weak and statistically insignificant relationship between contextual factors and teachers' ICT beliefs, indicating that external conditions may not heavily impact teachers' attitudes toward ICT. Furthermore, the study identifies a very weak but statistically significant relationship between teachers' ICT beliefs and their ICT usage, implying that teachers' beliefs do have a minimal role in how they integrate technology into their teaching. The findings underscore the significance of considering contextual factors when implementing ICT in schools, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as urban slums. The study advocates for comprehensive and targeted interventions that address both the contextual challenges and the need to foster positive ICT beliefs among teachers. These interventions are crucial for establishing equitable and high-quality technology-enhanced learning environments that can yield long-term educational benefits.

# Multiscale Cell-Cell Interactive Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis

## 多尺度细胞-细胞交互空间转录组学分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5743704/latest

Spatial transcriptomics data analysis &amp;nbsp;integrates gene expression profiles with their corresponding spatial locations to identify spatial domains, infer &amp;nbsp;cell-type dynamics, and detect &amp;nbsp;gene expression patterns within tissues. However, the current spatial transcriptomics &amp;nbsp;analysis neglects the multiscale cell-cell interactions that are crucial in biology. To fill this gap, we propose &amp;nbsp;multiscale cell-cell interactive spatial transcriptomics (MCIST) analysis. MCIST combines the advantages of an ensemble of multiscale topological representations of cell-cell interactions in the gene expression space &amp;nbsp;with those of cutting edge spatial deep learning techniques. We validate MCIST by a comparison of 14 cutting edge methods on a huge collection of 37 benchmark spatial transcriptomics datasets. We demonstrate that MCIST yields superior performance in spatial domain detection. It &amp;nbsp;achieves the best clustering score on 23/37 datasets and is among the top three methods on 33/37 datasets, whereas the second best method scored only 6/37 and 17/37 on these measures, respectively. In terms of overall performance with regards to a quantitative metric, MCIST offers over an 11\% &amp;nbsp;improvement to the previous state-of-the-art in spatial domain detection. Additionally, MCIST offers multiscale insights with respect to trajectory inference, differentially expressed gene detection, and signaling pathway enrichment analysis. Our MCIST sheds valuable light on the multiscale perspective in spatial transcriptomics.
