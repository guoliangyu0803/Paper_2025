# Robust heteronuclear correlations for proteins in ultrafast magic-angle spinning

## 超快魔角旋转中蛋白质的稳健异核相关性

**Authors:** Yan, Zhang

Under ultrafast magic-angle spinning (MAS), proton-detected solid-state nuclear magnetic  resonance  (ssNMR)  has  emerged  as  a  powerful  technique  for  elucidating structures  from  sub-milligram  protein,  where  establishing 
13C-15N  correlations  is essential. However, traditional 
13C-15N cross-polarization (CP), which performs well at 
lower MAS frequencies, suffers diminished efficiency under ultrafast MAS conditions. To address this challenge, we have developed a robust method for selective polarization 
between  insensitive  nuclei  (SPINE).  This  approach  significantly  enhances  the efficiency of heteronuclear 
13C-15N correlation compared to CP, achieving gain factors 
of 1.75 for 13CA-15N and 1.9 and 13CO-15N transfers. These enhancements can reduce the duration of current multi-dimensional experiments  to approximately one-third of that required by 13C-15N CP and to approximately one-tenth when involving two 13C-15N transfers. The effectiveness of SPINE has been validated through experiments on four  distinct  proteins:  the  microcrystalline  β1  immunoglobulin  binding  domain  of protein  G  (GB1),  the  large-conductance  mechanosensitive  ion  channel  from Methanosarcina acetivorans (MaMscL),  fibrillar septum-forming protein  (SepF), and the vertex protein of  the β-carboxysome  shell  (CcmL). These  findings highlight  the practical utility and versatility of SPINE in ssNMR spectroscopy, making it a valuable approach for structural biology applications.

# Light-Driven Paramagnetic Tags for Efficient Pseudocontact Shifts Measurments in Protein NMR Spectroscopy

## 用于蛋白质NMR光谱中有效伪接触位移测量的光驱动顺磁标签

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-m7hkl?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Ling, Jiang

Pseudocontact shifts (PCS) values are essential for studies of protein structure and dynamics. However, structural calcu-lations typically require multiple tags or labeling at multiple sites, which can be both time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we demonstrate that two independent sets of PCS values can be obtained using an azobenzene-based paramag-netic probe. Upon photo-isomerization, the magnetic field around the protein is redistributed, resulting in a distinct NMR spectrum and enabling the acquisition of a new set of structural constraints. This light-driven spatial motion of the para-magnetic center eliminates the need for additional mutations or chemical activators to induce magnetic transitions, pav-ing the way for the development of tensor-switchable paramagnetic tags.

# Enabling nondestructive observation of electrolyte composition in batteries with ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance

## 通过超低场核磁共振对电池中的电解质成分进行无损观察

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-32xj9-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Mengjiang, Lin

Although reliable rechargeable batteries represent a key transformative technology for electric vehicles, portable electronics, and renewable energy, there are few nondestructive diagnostic techniques compatible with realistic commercial cell enclosures. Many battery failures result from the loss or chemical degradation of electrolyte. In this work, we present measurements through battery enclosures that allow quantification of electrolyte amount and composition. The study employs instrumentation and techniques developed in the context of zero-to-ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR), with optical atomic magnetometers as the detection elements. In contrast to conventional NMR methodology, which suffers from skin-depth limitations, the reduced resonance frequencies in ZULF NMR make battery housing and electrodes transparent to the electromagnetic fields involved. As demonstrated here through simulation and experiment, both the solvent and lithium-salt components of the electrolyte (LiPF6) signature could be quantified using our techniques. Further, we show that the apparatus is compatible with measurement of pouch-cell batteries.

# Influence of pristine and oxidized MWCNT fillers on ferroelectricity and dielectric dispersion of a classical ferroelectric of Rochelle salt

## 原始和氧化的MWCNT填料对罗谢尔盐经典铁电体的铁电性和介电分散性的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5738858/latest

This paper reports a comparative study on the influence of pristine and oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes on ferroelectricity and dielectric dispersion of a classical ferroelectric of Rochelle salt in a range of 10&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;2 &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;107 Hz with an amplitude of electric field strength of 2 V/cm. For the study, phase transition, polarization switching, frequency dependencies of dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity of two composites based on Rochelle salt combined with each of the fillers were considered at different temperatures. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to explore the influence of fillers on the functional groups of Rochelle salt. The morphologies of the samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy. It was revealed that the oxidized form of multiwalled carbon nanotubes showed less influence on the dielectric dispersion, but stronger effect on the phase transition and polarization switching than those of pristine ones. At the same time, the high electrical conductivity of both carbon nanotubes resulted in a strong dielectric dispersion and overshadowed the contribution of functional groups of Rochelle salt. Theoretical models will also be used to analyze experimental data.

# Reliability and Validity of a Mobile Three-Dimensional Application for Humeral Retroversion Measurement

## 用于肱骨后倾测量的移动三维应用程序的可靠性和有效性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5714513/latest

Background Humeral fractures and conditions such as Little League Shoulder are common across different age groups, necessitating accurate evaluation of humeral retroversion, especially in preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative settings. At present, the gold-standard methods for evaluation, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although effective, expose patients to radiation and incur high costs, particularly in pediatric patients.Methods  This retrospective study reviewed 74 patients who underwent conventional humeral AP radiography, lateral radiography, and CT between May 2020 and July 2022. Using mobile application, conventional radiography-based three-dimensional (3D) humeral reconstruction was performed. Humeral retroversion measurements obtained via the application were compared with those obtained from CT. Reliability was evaluated using intraobserver and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). In addition, the correlation coefficients between the two methods were calculated.Results Mobile application showed excellent intraobserver reliability (ICC&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.937) and high interobserver reliability (ICC&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.901) in humeral retroversion measurements, compared to CT scans, which showed lower ICCs. In addition, no significant difference was found between the retroversion measurements using CT and the mobile application (mean difference: -0.3, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.816). The correlation coefficient between the two methods was strong (0.886, p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001), indicating that the application provides results comparable to those of CT.Conclusion Mobile application offers a reliable, cost-effective, and accessible alternative to CT for evaluating humeral retroversion. It demonstrates comparable accuracy while minimizing radiation exposure and costs, making it an attractive option for clinical practice and research, particularly for pediatric patients and athletes. Future prospective studies are warranted to further validate the application of the mobile application across broader clinical scenarios and establish a standardized approach for measuring retroversion.Level of evidence Level III retrospective cohort study

# Extragenital and Extrapelvic Endometriosis: Literature Update and Mri Immaging Case Collection of Unusual Localizations

## 生殖器外和盆腔外子宫内膜异位症: 文献更新和异常定位的Mri影像病例收集

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5595138/latest

Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age and is a significant cause of pelvic pain and infertility. It manifests in three patterns: superficial peritoneal lesions, ovarian endometriomas, and deep infiltrating endometriosis. Our aim is to remind radiologists of the possibility of atypical locations of pelvic and extrapelvic endometriosis and to illustrate their characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging.
The most common site of endometriosis is the ovaries, followed by the pelvic peritoneum. Less common locations include deep subperitoneal tissues, the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder, the thorax, and subcutaneous tissues. We present three rare clinical cases: diaphragmatic endometriosis, inguinal canal endometriosis, and a case of sciatic nerve infiltration. MRI imaging provides important findings that help classify the disease and identify the extent of the lesion, thus facilitating appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Radiologists should be familiar with the MRI imaging findings of deep infiltrating endometriosis in various anatomical sites to provide information that allows for adequate pre-surgical counseling.

# Analysis of Seismo-ionospheric Anomaly Disturbance Associ-ated with the Mw7.6 Mexico Earthquake on 19 September 2022

## 与2022年9月19日墨西哥Mw7.6地震相关的地震-电离层异常扰动分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5696226/latest

Based on GNSS ionospheric data, this paper detected and investigated the pre-earthquake ionospheric anomalies of the 7.6 magnitude earthquake that occurred in Mexico on September 19, 2022. 10.7 cm solar radio flux (F10.7), sunspot number (SSN), global geomagnetic activity Index (KP) and geomagnetic activity index in equatorial region (DST) are employed to reflect solar and geomagnetic activities, respectively. The result of the sliding quartile range method indicates that the TEC anomaly over the epicenter on 15th day before the earthquake was the most significant, but the geomagnetic activity was abnormal on that day. To further distinguish whether the ionospheric disturbance on 15th day was caused by geomagnetic activity or earthquake, this paper adopts the coherent wavelet to analyze the time-varying relationship between total electron content (TEC) and geomagnetic activity in the time-frequency space. The results show that the correlation between TEC, Kp and Dst is slightly weakened in the low-frequency range due to the enhancement of geomagnetic activity on 15th day, but the phase relationship remained stable. While the strong correlation between TEC, Kp and Dst suddenly disappeared and phase relationship sharply changed after 10th day. This was due to the influence of seismic-ionospheric coupling effect, where the abnormal disturbances in TEC disrupted the pre-existing stable relationship between TEC, Kp, and Dst. Therefore, we conclude that the TEC anomaly on 10th day before the earthquake was the precursor to the Mw7.6 Mexico.

# Investigating Application of Nonlinear Semi-active Impact Dampers for Suppressing Forced Vibrations

## 研究非线性半主动冲击阻尼器在抑制强迫振动中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5741114/latest

In this study, the effects of utilizing a vibro-impact electromechanical device to suppress undesired vibrations are investigated. The demonstrated vibro-impact system serves as a vibration suppressor and provides the necessary energy for its sensors and control components, making it a potentially autonomous system. The electromechanical equation of motion for the system under examination is calculated and experimentally verified. Also, the effect of adjusting the gap size, a crucial parameter of the Vibro-impact system, on its electromechanical performance of the system is investigated. Additionally, the effectiveness parameter is announced as a parameter that results in enhancing the energy harvesting and vibration-suppressing capabilities of the demonstrated vibro-impact system. Finally, it is demonstrated that the characteristics of the electromagnetic vibro-impact system can be tuned as an effective autonomous semi-active impact damper system.
