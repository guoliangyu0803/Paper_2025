Allard<br /><p>The sensitivity of ultracold-atom sensors has great potential for on-board applications, but achieving this precision outside the laboratory requires a robust, compact atom source. This work presents a hybrid atom chip that combines two techniques to simplify the cold-atom source: optical gratings for single-beam laser cooling and conductive microcircuits for tight magnetic confinement. This hybrid configuration also achieves Bose-Einstein condensation. This research paves the way for integrating more advanced features into atomic chips with applications in atomic interferometry and atomtronics.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRAPPLIED/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.23.L011001.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01492

**Authors:** Gabriel Cardoso, Liu Yang, Thors Hans Hansson, Qing-Dong Jiang

arXiv:2501.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we study the coupling of quantum Hall (QH) hydrodynamics to quantum electrodynamics (QED) within a resonance cavity. In agreement with experimental observations, we find that the Hall conductivity remains unchanged. However, the coupling to the cavity induces a second-order quantum reactance effect, contributing distinctly to the longitudinal AC conductivity. This effect arises from the exchange of energy between the QH fluid and cavity photons. Beyond the topological response, we show that the cavity couples to collective excitations, resulting in a shift of the Kohn mode frequency. Our methods are broadly applicable to both integral and fractional QH liquids, and our results offer a universal perspective on the protection of topological properties against long-range interactions induced by electromagnetic cavity modes.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of spin dynamics in the (Mo2/3Tb1/3)2AlC i-MAX compound using ac susceptibility measurements across a range of magnetic fields. Unique behaviors were observed, including spin dynamics in the kHz range between mu_0 H~0.2T-6T, indicating a non-trivial superparamagnetic state, suggesting that the compound acts as a transitional system within the i-MAX family, bridging stable spin-dynamic materials and fluctuation-dominated ones. Field- and frequency-dependent magnetic phase transitions, coupled with relaxation behaviors, reveal complex interactions between spin density waves and superparamagnetic components. These findings, corroborated by uSR studies, deepen our understanding of magnetic phase diagrams and field-induced phenomena in i-MAX systems, laying the groundwork for further exploration of their unique properties and applications.

arXiv:2501.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a magnetoconductivity tensor $\sigma$ for the intercalated graphite CaC$_6$, in the ground state of the uniaxial charge density wave (CDW), under conditions of coherent magnetic breakdown due to strong external magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the conducting plane. The uniaxial charge density wave reconstructs initially closed Fermi surface into an open one, accompanied with formation of a pseudo-gap in the electron density of states around the Fermi energy. The magnetoconductivity tensor is calculated within the quantum density matrix and semiclassical magnetic breakdown approach focused on modification of the main, so-called classical contribution to magnetoconductivity by magnetic breakdown, neglecting the higher order corrections. In the presence of magnetic breakdown, in spite of open Fermi surface configuration, all classical magnetoconductivity components, the one along the CDW apex $\sigma_{xx} \sim 1/B^2$, perpendicular to the CDW apex $\sigma_{yy} \sim const$, as well as the Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} \sim 1/B$, undergo strong quantum oscillations vs. inverse magnetic field. Those oscillations do not appear as a mere additive correction, but rather alter the classical result becoming an inherent part of it, turning it to essentially non-classical.

Abstract: One of the possible approaches to decrease the demand for critical elements such as rare earths is to develop new sustainable magnets. Iron-based materials are suitable for gap magnets applications since iron is the most abundant ferromagnetic element on Earth. Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ is a candidate as gap magnet thanks to its high Curie temperature (T$_{\text{C}} \sim$ 800 K) and saturation magnetization (M$_{\text{S}}\sim$ 140 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$). However its anisotropy field is too low for applications (H$_{\text{A}} \sim$ 0.8 T). In order to increase the anisotropy value, we synthesized a series of Ge, Re and Cr substituted Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ samples and studied their magnetic properties. They all crystallize in the Cr$_5$B$_3$-type tetragonal structure with the $I4/mcm$ space group. Curie temperature (T$_{\text{C}}$ = 803 K) and saturation magnetization (M$_{\text{S}}$ = 138 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$) are slightly decreased by elemental substitution with Re having the largest effect. Despite being reduced, T$_{\text{C}}$ and M$_{\text{S}}$ still maintain significant values (T$_{\text{C}}>$ 750 K and M$_{\text{S}}$ = 118 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$). The room temperature anisotropy field has been measured by Singular Point Detection (SPD) and increases by about 15% upon Re substitution, reaching 0.92 T for Fe$_{4.75}$Re$_{0.25}$SiB$_2$. We have also used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and SPD measurements to study the spin reorientation transition which takes place at 172 K and we have found that it is partially suppressed by substitution of Ge from 172 K to 140 K and completely suppressed upon Cr and Re substitution.

Abstract: Nano-magnonic crystals are magnetic waveguides whose magnetic parameters are modulated at the nanoscale. The super-lattice structure enables a band structure and magnonic band-gaps. Here, we numerically investigate the field tunability of such a magnonic band-gap. By subjecting different parts of the nano-magnonic crystal to a field, we realize a magnonic heterojunction. A numerical demonstration of an active modification of the band structure leads to magnonic amplitude modulation in the linear regime and magnonic frequency combs in the nonlinear regime. Our results offer further opportunities for nano-magnonic crystals and incite their experimental realization.

arXiv:2501.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of magnetic phases in the Hubbard model under strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling on a square lattice. By using Lanczos exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations, we explore the emergence of various magnetic alignments as the ratio between the regular hopping amplitude, $t$, and the Rashba hopping term, $t_R$, is varied over a broad range of Hubbard interaction strengths, $U$. In the limit $t_R \rightarrow 0$, the system exhibits N\'eel antiferromagnetic order, while when $t \sim t_R$, a spiral magnetic phase emerges due to the induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. For $t_R > t$, we identify the onset of a spin vortex phase. At the extreme limit $t = 0$($t_R \neq 0 $), we perform finite-size scaling analysis in the Weyl semimetal regime to pinpoint the quantum critical point associated with the spin vortex phase, employing sign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations - the extracted critical exponents are consistent with a Gross-Neveu-type quantum phase transition.

Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we have found 49 ferromag-netic cases in FexN1-x (0<1) compounds, focusing especially on permanent magnet and giant magnetocaloric effect applications. It is found that 15 compounds are potential permanent mag-nets with a magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy more than 1 MJ/m3, filling in the gap of appli-cation spectrum between high-performance and widely used permanents. Among the potential permanent magnets, Fe2N can be classified as a hard magnet while the other 14 compounds can be classified as semi-hard magnets. According to the calculations of magnetic deformation proxy, 40 compounds are identified as potential giant magnetocaloric effect candidates. We suspect that Fe-N compounds provide fine opportunities for applications in both rare-earth free permanent magnets and magnetocaloric effect.

arXiv:2501.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our experimental (neutron diffraction, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat) and numerical studies on the evolution of short- and long-range magnetic order in $\gamma_{\rm II}$-Li\(_2\)FeSiO\(_4\) suggest a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nature of magnetism. The experimental data obtained on single crystals imply long-range antiferromagnetic order below $T_{\rm N}= 17$~K. A broad maximum in magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ at $T_{\rm m}\simeq 28$~K, observation of magnetic entropy changes up to 100~K and anisotropy in $\chi$ are indicative of low-dimensional magnetism and suggest short-range magnetic correlations up to 200~K. Neutron diffraction shows that long-range antiferromagnetic order is characterised by the propagation vector k=(1/2,0,1/2). The ordered moment $\mu = 2.50(2) \mu_B$ /Fe, at $T = 1.5$~K, is along the crystallographic $a$-axis. This is consistent with the observed static hyperfine field of $B_{\rm hyp}=14.8(3)$\,T by M\"ossbauer spectroscopy which indicates significant orbital contributions. The temperature dependence of $B_{\rm hyp}$ yields the critical exponent $\beta=0.116(12)$ which is in the regime of the 2D Ising behaviour. LSDA+U studies exploiting the experimental spin structure suggest dominating magnetic exchange coupling within the $ac$-layers (i.e., $J_3\simeq -6$~K and $J_6\simeq-2$~K) while interlayer coupling is much smaller and partly frustrated. This confirms the 2D nature of magnetism and is in full agreement with the experimental findings.

**Authors:** Man Li, Huan Ma, Rui Lou, Shancai Wang

arXiv:2501.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has garnered significant attention due to its ability to host quantum spin Fermi liquid states. Recently, the combination of unique lattice geometry, electron-electron correlations, and adjustable magnetism in solid kagome materials has led to the discovery of numerous fascinating quantum properties. These include unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves (CDW/SDW), pair density waves (PDW), and Chern insulator phases. These emergent states are closely associated with the distinctive characteristics of the kagome lattice's electronic structure, such as van Hove singularities, Dirac fermions, and flat bands, which can exhibit exotic quasi-particle excitations under different symmetries and magnetic conditions. Recently, various quantum kagome materials have been developed, typically consisting of kagome layers stacked along the $z$-axis with atoms either filling the geometric centers of the kagome lattice or embedded between the layers. In this topical review, we begin by introducing the fundamental properties of several kagome materials. To gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between topology and correlation, we then discuss the complex phenomena observed in these systems. These include the simplest kagome metal $T_3X$, kagome intercalation metal $TX$, and the ternary compounds $AT_6X_6$ and $RT_3X_5$ ($A$ = Li, Mg, Ca, or rare earth; $T$ = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; $X$ = Sn, Ge; $R$ = K, Rb, Cs). Finally, we provide a perspective on future experimental work in this field.

Abstract: Josephson junctions, as pivotal components of modern technologies such as superconducting quantum computing, owe their prominence to their unique nonlinear properties at low temperatures. Despite their extensive use in static configurations, the study of dynamic Josephson junctions, particularly under space-time modulation, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the interaction and transmission of electromagnetic waves through arrays of space-time-modulated Josephson junctions. A comprehensive mathematical framework is presented to model the propagation of electric and magnetic fields within and beyond these structures. We demonstrate how such dynamic arrays enable groundbreaking four-dimensional light manipulation, achieving angular-frequency beam multiplexing through a seamless integration of frequency conversion and beam-splitting functionalities. These advancements open new horizons for electromagnetic field engineering, with far-reaching implications for superconducting quantum technologies, next-generation wireless communications, biomedical sensing, and radar systems.

Magnetization, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity measurements confirm weakly coupled bulk type II superconductivity with a 7.21(3) K transition temperature and an upper critical field of 12.9(1) T. The upper critical field approaches the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggesting potential unconventional behavior. The low density, moderate transition temperature, and high upper critical field stand out Sc-Ti-V-Nb-Cu as a promising candidate for next-generation superconducting device applications.

Abstract: In-plane magnetization is induced by the Edelstein effect in the Rashba spin-orbit interaction system. However, out-of-plane magnetization is more useful for switching a ferromagnetic memory. We study analytically and numerically electric-field induced magnetization in $p$-wave magnets with the aid of the Rashba interaction based on a simple two-band model. The out-of-plane magnetization is induced when the N\'{e}el vector of the $p$-wave magnet is along the $z$ direction. We also show that no magnetization is induced in the absence of the Rashba interaction. The electric-field induced magnetization will be useful for future switching technology of ferromagnetic memories based on the $p$-wave magnet.

Abstract: The dimensionality of vortical structures has recently been extended beyond two dimensions, providing higher-order topological characteristics and robustness for high-capacity information processing and turbulence control. The generation of high-dimensional vortical structures has mostly been demonstrated in classical systems through the complex interference of fluidic, acoustic, or electromagnetic waves. However, natural materials rarely support three- or higher-dimensional vortical structures and their physical interactions. Here, we present a high-dimensional gradient thickness optical cavity (GTOC) in which the optical coupling of planar metal-dielectric multilayers implements topological interactions across multiple dimensions. Topological interactions in high-dimensional GTOC construct non-trivial topological phases, which induce high-dimensional vortical structures in generalized parameter space in three, four dimensions, and beyond. These emergent high-dimensional vortical structures are observed under electro-optic tomography as optical vortex dynamics in two-dimensional real-space, employing the optical thicknesses of the dielectric layers as synthetic dimensions. We experimentally demonstrate emergent vortical structures, optical vortex lines and vortex rings, in a three-dimensional generalized parameter space and their topological transitions. Furthermore, we explore four-dimensional vortical structures, termed optical vortex sheets, which provide the programmability of real-space optical vortex dynamics. Our findings hold significant promise for emulating high-dimensional physics and developing active topological photonic devices.

Abstract: This project explores the design and development of a transition edge sensor (TES) spectrometer for resonant soft X- ray scattering (RSXS) measurements developed in collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Soft X-ray scattering is a powerful technique for studying the electronic and magnetic properties of materials on a microscopic level. However, the lack of high-performance soft X-ray spectrometers has limited the potential of this technique. TES spectrometers have the potential to overcome these limitations due to their high energy resolution, high efficiency, and broad energy range. This project aims to optimize the design of a TES spectrometer for RSXS measurements and more generally soft X-ray spectroscopy at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) 29-ID, leading to improved understanding of advanced materials. We will present a detailed description of the instrument design and implementation. The spectrometer consists of a large array of approximately 250 high-speed and high-resolution pixels. The pixels have saturation energies of approximately 1 keV, sub-ms pulse duration and energy resolution of approximately 1 eV. The array is read out using microwave multiplexing chips with MHz bandwidth per channel, enabling efficient data throughput. To facilitate measurement of samples in situ under ultra-high vacuum conditions at the beamline, the spectrometer is integrated with an approximately 1 m long snout.

Abstract: Scale invariance and self-similarity in physics provide a unified framework to classify phases of matter and dynamical properties near equilibrium in both classical and quantum systems. This paradigm has been further extended to isolated many-body quantum systems driven far from equilibrium, where physical observables exhibit dynamical scaling with universal scaling exponents. Universal dynamics appear in a wide range of scenarios, including cosmology, quark-gluon matter, ultracold atoms, and quantum spin magnets. However, how universal dynamics depend on the symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian in nonequilibrium systems remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we report on the classification of universal coarsening dynamics in a quenched two-dimensional ferromagnetic spinor Bose gas. We observe spatiotemporal scaling of spin correlation functions with distinguishable scaling exponents that characterize binary and diffusive fluids. The universality class of the coarsening dynamics is determined by the symmetry of the order parameter and the dynamics of the topological defects, such as domain walls and vortices. Our results provide a categorization of the universality classes of far from equilibrium quantum dynamics based on symmetry properties of the system.

Abstract: Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.

Abstract: Quenched randomness strongly affects properties of magnetic materials. Two-dimensional (2D) random singlet (RS) states emerge in random $J$-$Q$ model by destroying valence bond solid order with spatial randomness. We examine the 2D RS state in magnetic field with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetization and susceptibilities show power-law scaling with magnetic field at low temperature. Moreover, they show one-parameter scaling behavior with $B/T$, and the scaling functions are remarkably consistent with a phenomenological model of random spin pairs with a singular distribution of interactions. These universal scaling functions can be used to diagnose 2D RS states in experiments.

Abstract: We theoretically study the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) in a perpendicular magnetic field. In the noninteracting case, the QSHI with space inversion and/or uniaxial spin rotation symmetry undergoes a topological transition into a normal insulator phase at a critical magnetic field $B_{\rm c}$. The exciton condensation in the lowest Landau levels is triggered by Coulomb interactions in the vicinity of $B_{\rm c}$ at low temperature and spontaneously breaks the inversion and the spin rotation symmetries. We propose that the electron spin resonance spectroscopy with the ac magnetic field also aligned in the perpendicular direction can directly probe the exciton condensation order. Our results should apply to QSHIs such as the InAs/GaSb quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: Monte Carlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such shapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and polar nematic phases. The nematic exhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique, polar, $\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a mirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods=form chirality. A comprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the nematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation is distinct from the elastic deformations of a uniaxial nematic director in the twist-bend nematic phase. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the isotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar director in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form chirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems from the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature nematic ''$\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.

Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. Minimization of the total energy indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic field larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall system the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall systems the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.

Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.

Abstract: SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high-$Q$, frequency-tuneable resonator which is both resilient to magnetic field, and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher $H_{c}$ metal such as niobium, however the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tuneability at $T = 16$ mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterise the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field, and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design which can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.

Abstract: We report on the performance evaluation of a prototype muon trigger detector for the PSI muEDM experiment, conducted as a proof-of-principle test at the $\pi$E1 beamline of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) using \SI{27.5}{MeV/c} muons. The detector is designed to identify muons within the acceptance phase space of a compact storage solenoid and activate a pulsed magnetic kicker for muon storage; it was tested without the application of a magnetic field. It comprises a telescope made up of four scintillators in anticoincidence with a gate scintillator, all read out by silicon photomultipliers. The study focused on characterizing the detector's response to various muon trajectories and the light yield of its plastic scintillators. Experimental results demonstrated strong agreement with Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate optical photon modeling, confirming the detector's concept and its potential for meeting the stringent requirements of the muEDM experiment.

Abstract: Topological materials for classical waves offer remarkable potential in applications such as sensing, waveguiding and signal processing, leveraging topological protection effects like strong robustness, immunity to backscattering and unidirectional transmission. This work presents the simultaneous inverse design of pseudospin-dependent topological edge states for acoustic and electromagnetic waves in two-dimensional $C_{\textrm{6v}}$ phoxonic crystals. The phoxonic crystals are created by arranging the silicon columns periodically in the air background. We propose a multi-objective optimization framework based on the NSGA-II collaborated with the finite element approach, where the bandgaps of acoustic and electromagnetic waves are treated separately as the objective values. The topological nature of bandgaps is determined by analyzing the positional relationships of paired degenerate modes through the modal field calculations, enabling the customization of one of the two bandgaps within the same unit cell. Unlike traditional approaches relying on the band inversion to induce topological phase transitions, the proposed approach directly generates a pair of unit cells with distinct topological properties for both wave types, achieving the maximum bandgap matching in each case. We further demonstrate the existence of the pseudospin-dependent topological edge states for both acoustic and electromagnetic waves, verifying their unidirectionality and robustness against backscattering and defects. This work establishes a systematic strategy for customizing phoxonic topological states, offering a new avenue for the inverse design of multi-functional devices based on both sound and light.

Abstract: This project explores the design and development of a transition edge sensor (TES) spectrometer for resonant soft X- ray scattering (RSXS) measurements developed in collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Soft X-ray scattering is a powerful technique for studying the electronic and magnetic properties of materials on a microscopic level. However, the lack of high-performance soft X-ray spectrometers has limited the potential of this technique. TES spectrometers have the potential to overcome these limitations due to their high energy resolution, high efficiency, and broad energy range. This project aims to optimize the design of a TES spectrometer for RSXS measurements and more generally soft X-ray spectroscopy at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) 29-ID, leading to improved understanding of advanced materials. We will present a detailed description of the instrument design and implementation. The spectrometer consists of a large array of approximately 250 high-speed and high-resolution pixels. The pixels have saturation energies of approximately 1 keV, sub-ms pulse duration and energy resolution of approximately 1 eV. The array is read out using microwave multiplexing chips with MHz bandwidth per channel, enabling efficient data throughput. To facilitate measurement of samples in situ under ultra-high vacuum conditions at the beamline, the spectrometer is integrated with an approximately 1 m long snout.

Abstract: We propose a method for interpolating divergence-free continuous magnetic fields via vector potential reconstruction using Hermite interpolation, which ensures high-order continuity for applications requiring adaptive, high-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) integrators, such as the Dormand-Prince method. The method provides C(m) continuity and achieves high-order accuracy, making it particularly suited for particle trajectory integration and Poincar\'e section analysis under optimal integration order and timestep adjustments. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the Hermite interpolation method preserves volume and continuity, which are critical for conserving toroidal canonical momentum and magnetic moment in guiding center simulations, especially over long-term trajectory integration. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of insufficient derivative continuity on Runge-Kutta schemes and show how it degrades accuracy at low error tolerances, introducing discontinuity-induced truncation errors. Finally, we demonstrate performant Poincar\'e section analysis in two relevant settings of field data collocated from finite element meshes

Abstract: Josephson junctions, as pivotal components of modern technologies such as superconducting quantum computing, owe their prominence to their unique nonlinear properties at low temperatures. Despite their extensive use in static configurations, the study of dynamic Josephson junctions, particularly under space-time modulation, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the interaction and transmission of electromagnetic waves through arrays of space-time-modulated Josephson junctions. A comprehensive mathematical framework is presented to model the propagation of electric and magnetic fields within and beyond these structures. We demonstrate how such dynamic arrays enable groundbreaking four-dimensional light manipulation, achieving angular-frequency beam multiplexing through a seamless integration of frequency conversion and beam-splitting functionalities. These advancements open new horizons for electromagnetic field engineering, with far-reaching implications for superconducting quantum technologies, next-generation wireless communications, biomedical sensing, and radar systems.

Abstract: Recent solar observations of bipolar light bridges (BLBs) in sunspots have, in a few individual cases, revealed magnetic fields up to 8.2 kG, which is at least twice as strong as typical values measured in sunspot umbrae. However, the small number of such observations hinted that such strong fields in these bright photospheric features that separate two opposite-polarity umbrae, are a rare phenomenon. We determine the field strength in a large sample of BLBs with the aim of establishing how prevalent such strong fields are in BLBs. We apply a state-of-the-art inversion technique that accounts for the degradation of the data by the intrinsic point spread function of the telescope, to the so far largest set of spectropolarimetric observations, by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter, of sunspots containing BLBs. We identified 98 individual BLBs within 51 distinct sunspot groups. Since 66.3% of the BLBs were observed multiple times, a total of 630 spectropolarimetric scans of these 98 BLBs were analysed. All analysed BLBs contain magnetic fields stronger than 4.5 kG at unit optical depth. The field strengths decrease faster with height than the fields in umbrae and penumbrae. BLBs display a unique continuum intensity and field strength combination, forming a population well separated from umbrae and the penumbrae. The high brightness of BLBs in spite of their very strong magnetic fields points to the presence of a so far largely unexplored regime of magnetoconvection.

Abstract: The decay of a turbulent magnetic field is slower with helicity than without. Furthermore, the magnetic correlation length grows faster for a helical than a nonhelical field. Both helical and nonhelical decay laws involve conserved quantities: the mean magnetic helicity density and the Hosking integral. Using direct numerical simulations in a triply periodic domain, we show quantitatively that in the fractionally helical case the mean magnetic energy density and correlation length are approximately given by the maximum of the values for the purely helical and purely nonhelical cases. The time of switch-over from one to the other decay law can be obtained on dimensional grounds and is approximately given by $I_\mathrm{H}^{1/2}I_\mathrm{M}^{-3/2}$, where $I_\mathrm{H}$ is the Hosking integral and $I_\mathrm{M}$ is the mean magnetic helicity density. An earlier approach based on the decay time is found to agree with our new result and suggests that the Hosking integral exceeds naive estimates by the square of the same resistivity-dependent factor by which also the turbulent decay time exceeds the Alfv\'en time. In the presence of an applied magnetic field, the mean magnetic helicity density is known to be not conserved, and we show that then also the Hosking integral is not conserved.

Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.

Combinatorial optimization problems are foundational challenges in fields such as artificial intelligence, logistics, and network design. Traditional algorithms, including greedy methods and dynamic programming, often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality, particularly as problem complexity scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel and efficient probabilistic optimization framework that integrates true random number generators (TRNGs) based on spin-transfer torque magnetic tunneling junctions (STT-MTJs). The inherent stochastic switching behavior of STT-MTJs enables dynamic configurability of random number distributions, which we leverage to introduce controlled randomness into a probabilistic greedy algorithm. By tuning a temperature parameter, our algorithm seamlessly transitions between deterministic and stochastic strategies, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we apply this framework to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), showcasing its ability to consistently produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem scales. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both solution quality and convergence speed compared to classical approaches, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Specifically, in larger TSP instances involving up to 70 cities, it retains its performance advantage, achieving near-optimal solutions with fewer iterations and reduced computational costs. This work highlights the potential of integrating MTJ-based TRNGs into optimization algorithms, paving the way for future applications in probabilistic computing and hardware-accelerated optimization.

# Research on ZWD Forecasting Model Based on Improved Random Forest Algorithm

## 基于改进随机森林算法的ZWD预测模型研究

When electromagnetic wave signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) pass through the troposphere, they are impeded by atmospheric conditions, thereby affecting positioning efficiency. The atmosphere is rich in water vapor information, which can typically be studied quantitatively through tropospheric zenith wet delay (ZWD). Therefore, high-precision forecasting models of ZWD are of significant research importance in GNSS positioning enhancement, weather forecasting, and water vapor inversion. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm has advantages in terms of improving accuracy, resistance to overfitting, and assessing feature importance. Aiming at the complex spatiotemporal patterns of global ZWD and the difficulty in establishing high-precision models, this paper develops a high-precision ZWD forecasting model based on the RF algorithm. In this study, we processed global ZWD data from 2021 to 2024, studied the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of ZWD from 2021 to 2023, analyzed the spatial distribution patterns and temporal variation trends of ZWD, and the time series data of ZWD was used as input for the RF algorithm to construct a global ZWD forecasting model, plotted the testing set prediction results, regression charts, error histograms, feature importance diagrams, and error curves, and calculated precision indicators such as mean absolute error, root mean square error, mean percentage error, and coefficient of determination to comprehensively evaluate the model's accuracy. The results indicate that the ZWD forecasting model based on the RF algorithm has a higher accuracy in the equatorial region, with an optimal value reaching 96.14%. When predicting for stations worldwide, the testing set's mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are all relatively small, while the R2 value is comparatively large, with average values of 1.623 cm, 2.146 cm, 19.478%, and 0.691, respectively. Compared to similar models, the new model developed in this study shows a significantly improved forecasting performance. In the current landscape of ZWD forecasting models, there is a scarcity of models that offer global coverage and extended forecast durations. The model developed in this study is capable of providing one-month ahead forecasts for ZWD across the globe, thereby providing theoretical and data support for the establishment of additional long-term global forecasting models in the future.

# Low-frequency oscillations in the magnetic nozzle of a Helicon Plasma Thruster

Oscillations within the plume of a Helicon Plasma Thruster are experimentally characterized. An array of electrically-floating probes is used to resolve the power spectral density, the coherence, and the wavevector components along both the azimuthal and parallel directions relative to the magnetic field, at various locations and for two mass flow rates. Two main features are identified: a very low-frequency (~4 kHz), global oscillation mode, attributed to an ionization instability in the source; and a broadband, low-coherence, essentially-azimuthal, ion-acoustic-like spectrum at &amp;lt;200 kHz. Within this range, a mild peak of larger coherence is found ~50 kHz, followed by a weak secondary peak at ~100 kHz at some locations. A bi-coherence analysis discards any nonlinear interaction within the &amp;lt;1 MHz band. However, significant coupling is found between the broadband fluctuations and the Helicon driving frequency of 13.56 MHz, which suggests that the former are likely the result of a parametric decay instability.
