# Research on on-site periodontitis self-examination technology based on closed cartridge

## 基于封闭式药筒的牙周炎现场自检技术研究

Periodontitis is a prevalent inflammatory disease, with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) identified as the primary causative bacterium of periodontal infection. In addition to its role in chronic periodontitis, Pg has also been associated with head and neck tumors, digestive tract tumors, neurological diseases, and atherosclerosis (AS). Therefore, establishing a rapid clinical detection method for Pg is of paramount importance. In this study, we developed a LAMP detection reagent for Pg, and assessed its performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, stability, linear range, and linearity using a commercial magnetic bead-based method. The integrated nucleic acid extraction and detection system has created an on-site instant detection platform for Pg based on a closed cartridge, demonstrating a sensitivity of 10 CFU/mL, no cross-reactivity with eight other bacterial pathogens, and excellent performance in repeatability, stability, linear range, and linearity. For 28 simulated samples, the detection results from the integrated system were consistent with the experimental outcomes of qPCR and LAMP detection following nucleic acid extraction in a conventional laboratory setting. The entire process can be completed in approximately one hour, significantly reducing the time required for clinical diagnosis and indicating substantial practical needs and application prospects.
