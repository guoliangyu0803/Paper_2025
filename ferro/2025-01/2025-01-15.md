## 影响连续多节段胸椎的Melorheostosis导致双侧下肢瘫痪: 一例病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5777361/latest

Background: Melorheostosis is a non-hereditary, benign, sclerotic bone dysplasia that typically affects a single limb, involving both bones and adjacent soft tissues. It is rare in both clinical and radiological presentations.As the disease rarely involves the spine and exhibits inconspicuous early symptoms, it is frequently overlooked, leading to delayed diagnosis and missed treatment windows. Recently, we successfully diagnosed and managed a patient.
Case presentation: A 30-year-old male presented with a one-year history of progressive numbness and weakness in both lower limbs without obvious cause. Following a full-length X-ray of the lower limbs, a diagnosis of melorheostosis was considered, and conservative drug therapy was initiated. However, his symptoms worsened, progressing to paraplegia.At our hospital, further spine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple signal changes in the thoracic vertebrae, spinal canal stenosis at the T6-T8 levels, and spinal cord degeneration at the corresponding segments.The patient underwent thoracic spinal canal decompression surgery, resulting in significant improvement in the symptoms of both lower limbs postoperatively.
Conclusion: This case suggests that in patients with melorheostosis presenting with neurological symptoms, potential spinal involvement should be considered. Comprehensive spinal examinations and timely diagnosis and treatment are essential for better prognosis.

Background Central neuropathies caused by diabetic nephropathy (DN) share similar characteristics. The present study aimed to analyze the changes in brain function of patients with DN based on the kidney&amp;ndash;brain axis.Methods The study population consisted of patients with DN and healthy controls (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;23 per group). Brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed on all participants, and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) values were calculated. The diagnostic authenticity was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curves using sensitivity, specificity, and Youden index. Statistical analysis included Pearson's correlation between mean fALFF values and DN data.Results The imaging analysis revealed that DN patients exhibited lower fALFF values in the right cingulum anterior segment (RCA) and left cingulum middle segment, and increased fALFF values in the right cingulum middle segment compared to control subjects. The correlation analysis demonstrated that mean fALFF values in the RCA correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate in DN patients.Conclusions The research findings demonstrated significant differences in fALFF values in the default mode network and visual cortex-related areas. These observations may be highly valuable for understanding the kidney&amp;ndash;brain axis mechanisms of DN, as well as the associations between diabetic microvascular complications.

# 12th Rib Length as a Predictor of Anatomical Variations in the Lumbosacral Plexus Associated with Atypical Radiculopathy in Lumbar Disc Herniation

## 12肋骨长度可作为腰椎间盘突出症非典型神经根病相关腰骶丛解剖变异的预测指标

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5812659/latest

Study Design: A combined clinical and cadaveric observational study.
Objectives: To investigate whether anatomical variations in the lumbosacral plexus (LSP) are associated with diagnostic discrepancies in lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and to corroborate clinical findings with anatomical evidence.
Summary of Background Data: LDH is typically diagnosed based on clinical neurological symptoms and the level of the compressed spinal nerve root (the responsible lesion) identified by magnetic resonance imaging. However, in some patients, radiculopathy symptoms do not always align with the responsible lesion, complicating the diagnosis. This discrepancy may be linked to anatomical variations in the LSP, although the exact cause remains unclear. LSP roots may exhibit cranio-caudal deviations, which tends to be associated with shorter or longer 12th ribs, providing a potential basis for investigation.
Methods: We examined 12th rib length in 144 patients with LDH at Juntendo University Hospital and investigated the relationship between LSP branch deviations and 12th rib length in 29 Japanese cadavers, donated to Juntendo University School of Medicine.
Results: Of the total, 102 cases showed matching radiculopathies and responsible lesions (matched group), while 42 cases exhibited discrepancies (mismatched group). The mismatched group was subdivided into: 19 cases with radiculopathy at a lower level than predicted by the responsible lesion (lower-level radiculopathy type) and 23 cases with radiculopathy at a higher level (higher-level radiculopathy). These types were significantly associated with shorter and longer 12th ribs, respectively, suggesting cranial and caudal deviations in LSP branches, confirmed by anatomical examination.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that contradictory neurological symptoms in LDH may be largely due to cranio-caudal deviations in the LSP and its branches. Furthermore, the 12th rib length may help predict these anatomical variations, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy in LDH.

# Unusual presentation of Lewis-Sumner Syndrome in elderly

## 老年人lewis-sumner综合征的异常表现

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5706040/latest

Lewis-Sumner Syndrome (LSS) is a rare disease that affect usually young adult. It is characterized by a proximal and especially distal myalgia, asymmetric muscle weakness, which mostly affects the upper limbs with early onset. Diagnosis can be difficult to establish if the clinical presentation is atypical. We report here a rare case of LSS in an old patient with unusual clinical aspects. A 70-year-old female patient with a history of atrial fibrillation complicated by pulmonary embolism, presented with myalgia and muscle weakness of the shoulders, upper arms, hips and thighs. This involvement was bilateral, symmetrical and evolving for 3 months, causing difficulties in climbing stairs, standing or walking. Physical examination showed a proximal muscle deficiency affecting proximal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. In this stage, we suspected an inflammatory myopathy or polymyalgia rheumatica. Biological investigation showed an inflammatory syndrome and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. The immunoblot polymyositis profile was negative. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of hips revealed a signal abnormality in the gluteus medius muscles on both sides with inflammatory appearance. The Electromyography revealed sensorimotor neuropathy affecting the four limbs more pronounced in lower ones, with motor nerve conduction blocks. The cerebrospinal fluid study revealed a proteinorachia at 0.4g/l with normal glycorachia and normal cell counts. These results confirmed the diagnosis of LSS. The patient was treated by corticosteroids at dose of 1 mg/ kg/ day during 2 months, with a progressive decrease of treatment. The evolution was marked by spectacular clinical and biological relief.

# A Low-intensity Rim on T2-weighted Brainstem Imaging is a Normal Finding and a Mimicker of Superficial Siderosis

## T2-weighted脑干成像上的低强度边缘是正常发现，并且是浅表含线病的模仿者。

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5695756/latest

Purpose: In healthy participants, T2 superficial localized low intensity (T2-SLL) similar to superficial siderosis has been observed in the brainstem. This study aimed to determine the incidence and causes of T2-SLL.
Methods: To determine the incidence, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) was performed on 114 patients (68 males; mean age: 59.1 years) using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner and visually assessed by two radiologists. T2-SLL presence in 22 brain areas was evaluated using the following system: 0 for absence, 1 for &amp;lt;50% surface, 2 for &ge;50% but not the entirety, and 3 for the entirety. After assessing inter-rater agreement, the scores were averaged. To investigate the causes of T2-SLL, an experimental MR imaging (MRI) was performed on a healthy male volunteer. To evaluate the chemical shift effect, the bandwidth and encoding direction were modified. To assess the magnetic susceptibility effect, T2*WI was performed using varying echo times (TEs).
Results: A moderate inter-rater score agreement (&kappa;=0.556) was observed. T2-SLL was identified in all participants and was most frequently observed on the frontal and lateral sides of the midbrain and pons, with the highest occurrence on the frontal of the upper pons (median 2.0; interquartile range 2.0&ndash;3.0). In the experimental MRI, no differences in T2-SLL were observed across the varying bandwidths and encoding directions. However, the superficial low signal for T2WI thickened as the TE lengthened, similar to blood vessels, suggesting a magnetic susceptibility effect.
Conclusion: T2-SLL can be regarded as a normal structure that may be associated with blood vessels.
