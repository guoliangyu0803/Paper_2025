# Melorheostosis affecting contiguous multi-segment thoracic vertebrae resulting in bilateral lower limb paralysis: A case report

## 影响连续多节段胸椎的Melorheostosis导致双侧下肢瘫痪: 一例病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5777361/latest

Background: Melorheostosis is a non-hereditary, benign, sclerotic bone dysplasia that typically affects a single limb, involving both bones and adjacent soft tissues. It is rare in both clinical and radiological presentations.As the disease rarely involves the spine and exhibits inconspicuous early symptoms, it is frequently overlooked, leading to delayed diagnosis and missed treatment windows. Recently, we successfully diagnosed and managed a patient.
Case presentation: A 30-year-old male presented with a one-year history of progressive numbness and weakness in both lower limbs without obvious cause. Following a full-length X-ray of the lower limbs, a diagnosis of melorheostosis was considered, and conservative drug therapy was initiated. However, his symptoms worsened, progressing to paraplegia.At our hospital, further spine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple signal changes in the thoracic vertebrae, spinal canal stenosis at the T6-T8 levels, and spinal cord degeneration at the corresponding segments.The patient underwent thoracic spinal canal decompression surgery, resulting in significant improvement in the symptoms of both lower limbs postoperatively.
Conclusion: This case suggests that in patients with melorheostosis presenting with neurological symptoms, potential spinal involvement should be considered. Comprehensive spinal examinations and timely diagnosis and treatment are essential for better prognosis.

摘要 (中文): 背景: melorheostososis是一种非遗传性，良性，硬化性骨发育不良，通常影响单个肢体，包括骨骼和相邻软组织。它在临床和影像学表现中都很少见。由于该病很少累及脊柱，早期症状不明显，因此经常被忽视，导致诊断延迟和治疗窗口的错过。最近，我们成功诊断并治疗了一名患者。
病例介绍: 一名30岁的男性，有1年的双下肢进行性麻木和无力的病史，没有明显的原因。在对下肢进行全长x线检查后，考虑了对melorheostosis的诊断，并开始了保守药物治疗。然而，他的症状恶化，进展为截瘫。在我们医院，进一步的脊柱计算机断层扫描 (CT) 和磁共振成像 (MRI) 显示胸椎的多个信号变化，T6-T8水平的椎管狭窄，患者行胸椎管减压手术，术后双下肢症状明显改善。
结论: 该病例表明，在出现神经系统症状的melorheostosis患者中，应考虑潜在的脊柱受累。全面的脊柱检查和及时的诊断和治疗对于更好的预后至关重要。

Background Central neuropathies caused by diabetic nephropathy (DN) share similar characteristics. The present study aimed to analyze the changes in brain function of patients with DN based on the kidney&amp;ndash;brain axis.Methods The study population consisted of patients with DN and healthy controls (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;23 per group). Brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed on all participants, and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) values were calculated. The diagnostic authenticity was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curves using sensitivity, specificity, and Youden index. Statistical analysis included Pearson's correlation between mean fALFF values and DN data.Results The imaging analysis revealed that DN patients exhibited lower fALFF values in the right cingulum anterior segment (RCA) and left cingulum middle segment, and increased fALFF values in the right cingulum middle segment compared to control subjects. The correlation analysis demonstrated that mean fALFF values in the RCA correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate in DN patients.Conclusions The research findings demonstrated significant differences in fALFF values in the default mode network and visual cortex-related areas. These observations may be highly valuable for understanding the kidney&amp;ndash;brain axis mechanisms of DN, as well as the associations between diabetic microvascular complications.

摘要 (中文): 背景由糖尿病肾病 (DN) 引起的中枢神经病变具有相似的特征。本研究旨在基于肾-脑轴分析DN患者脑功能的变化。方法研究人群由DN患者和健康对照组组成 (每组n   =   23)。对所有参与者进行脑静息态功能磁共振成像检查，并计算低频波动幅度分数 (fALFF) 值。通过使用灵敏度，特异性和Youden指数的接受者操作特征曲线来评估诊断的真实性。统计学分析包括平均fALFF值与DN数据之间的Pearson相关性。结果影像学分析显示，与对照组相比，DN患者的右扣带前段 (RCA) 和左扣带中段的fALFF值较低，右扣带中段的fALFF值升高。相关分析表明，RCA中的平均fALFF值与DN患者的估计肾小球滤过率相关。结论研究结果表明，默认模式网络和视觉皮层相关区域的fALFF值存在显着差异。这些观察结果对于理解DN的肾-脑轴机制以及糖尿病微血管并发症之间的关联可能非常有价值。

# 12th Rib Length as a Predictor of Anatomical Variations in the Lumbosacral Plexus Associated with Atypical Radiculopathy in Lumbar Disc Herniation

## 12肋骨长度可作为腰椎间盘突出症非典型神经根病相关腰骶丛解剖变异的预测指标

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5812659/latest

Study Design: A combined clinical and cadaveric observational study.
Objectives: To investigate whether anatomical variations in the lumbosacral plexus (LSP) are associated with diagnostic discrepancies in lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and to corroborate clinical findings with anatomical evidence.
Summary of Background Data: LDH is typically diagnosed based on clinical neurological symptoms and the level of the compressed spinal nerve root (the responsible lesion) identified by magnetic resonance imaging. However, in some patients, radiculopathy symptoms do not always align with the responsible lesion, complicating the diagnosis. This discrepancy may be linked to anatomical variations in the LSP, although the exact cause remains unclear. LSP roots may exhibit cranio-caudal deviations, which tends to be associated with shorter or longer 12th ribs, providing a potential basis for investigation.
Methods: We examined 12th rib length in 144 patients with LDH at Juntendo University Hospital and investigated the relationship between LSP branch deviations and 12th rib length in 29 Japanese cadavers, donated to Juntendo University School of Medicine.
Results: Of the total, 102 cases showed matching radiculopathies and responsible lesions (matched group), while 42 cases exhibited discrepancies (mismatched group). The mismatched group was subdivided into: 19 cases with radiculopathy at a lower level than predicted by the responsible lesion (lower-level radiculopathy type) and 23 cases with radiculopathy at a higher level (higher-level radiculopathy). These types were significantly associated with shorter and longer 12th ribs, respectively, suggesting cranial and caudal deviations in LSP branches, confirmed by anatomical examination.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that contradictory neurological symptoms in LDH may be largely due to cranio-caudal deviations in the LSP and its branches. Furthermore, the 12th rib length may help predict these anatomical variations, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy in LDH.

摘要 (中文): 研究设计: 一项临床和尸体联合观察研究。
目的: 探讨腰骶丛 (LSP) 的解剖变异是否与腰椎间盘突出症 (LDH) 的诊断差异有关，并以解剖学证据证实临床发现。
背景数据摘要: LDH通常是根据临床神经系统症状和磁共振成像确定的脊髓神经根受压水平 (负责任的病变) 来诊断的。然而，在一些患者中，神经根病的症状并不总是与负责的病变一致，使诊断复杂化。尽管确切原因尚不清楚，但这种差异可能与LSP的解剖变化有关。LSP根部可能表现出颅尾偏差，这往往与较短或较长的第12肋骨有关，为研究提供了潜在的基础。
方法: 我们检查了Juntendo大学医院144例LDH患者的第12根肋骨长度，并调查了捐赠给Juntendo大学医学院的29具日本尸体的LSP分支偏差与第12根肋骨长度之间的关系。
结果: 在总数中，102例显示匹配的神经根病和负责的病变 (匹配组)，而42例显示差异 (不匹配组)。不匹配组细分为: 19例神经根病水平低于责任病变预测水平 (较低水平的神经根病类型) 和23例神经根病水平较高 (较高水平的神经根病)。这些类型分别与较短和较长的第12肋骨显着相关，表明LSP分支的颅骨和尾部偏差，经解剖检查证实。
结论: 这些发现表明，LDH的矛盾神经系统症状可能很大程度上是由于LSP及其分支的颅尾偏离所致。此外，第12肋骨长度可能有助于预测这些解剖变化，从而可能提高LDH的诊断准确性。

# Unusual presentation of Lewis-Sumner Syndrome in elderly

## 老年人lewis-sumner综合征的异常表现

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5706040/latest

Lewis-Sumner Syndrome (LSS) is a rare disease that affect usually young adult. It is characterized by a proximal and especially distal myalgia, asymmetric muscle weakness, which mostly affects the upper limbs with early onset. Diagnosis can be difficult to establish if the clinical presentation is atypical. We report here a rare case of LSS in an old patient with unusual clinical aspects. A 70-year-old female patient with a history of atrial fibrillation complicated by pulmonary embolism, presented with myalgia and muscle weakness of the shoulders, upper arms, hips and thighs. This involvement was bilateral, symmetrical and evolving for 3 months, causing difficulties in climbing stairs, standing or walking. Physical examination showed a proximal muscle deficiency affecting proximal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. In this stage, we suspected an inflammatory myopathy or polymyalgia rheumatica. Biological investigation showed an inflammatory syndrome and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. The immunoblot polymyositis profile was negative. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of hips revealed a signal abnormality in the gluteus medius muscles on both sides with inflammatory appearance. The Electromyography revealed sensorimotor neuropathy affecting the four limbs more pronounced in lower ones, with motor nerve conduction blocks. The cerebrospinal fluid study revealed a proteinorachia at 0.4g/l with normal glycorachia and normal cell counts. These results confirmed the diagnosis of LSS. The patient was treated by corticosteroids at dose of 1 mg/ kg/ day during 2 months, with a progressive decrease of treatment. The evolution was marked by spectacular clinical and biological relief.

摘要 (中文): Lewis-Sumner综合征 (LSS) 是一种罕见的疾病，通常影响年轻人。它的特征是近端，特别是远端肌痛，不对称肌肉无力，主要影响早期发作的上肢。如果临床表现不典型，诊断可能很难确定。我们在这里报告了一位临床异常的老年患者的罕见LSS病例。一名70岁的女性患者，有房颤并发肺栓塞的病史，表现为肩膀，上臂，臀部和大腿的肌痛和肌肉无力。这种参与是双侧的，对称的，并且持续了3个月，导致爬楼梯，站立或行走困难。体格检查显示近端肌肉缺乏症影响上肢和下肢的近端肌肉。在此阶段，我们怀疑是炎症性肌病或风湿性多肌痛。生物学研究显示炎症综合征和乳酸脱氢酶水平升高。免疫印迹多发性肌炎概况为阴性。臀部的磁共振成像 (MRI) 显示两侧臀中肌信号异常，具有炎性外观。肌电图显示，感觉运动神经病影响下肢的四肢更为明显，并伴有运动神经传导阻滞。脑脊液研究显示蛋白质缺失为0.4g/l，糖正常，细胞计数正常。这些结果证实了LSS的诊断。患者在2个月期间以1 mg/ kg/天的剂量接受皮质类固醇治疗，治疗逐渐减少。这一演变的特点是壮观的临床和生物学缓解。

# A Low-intensity Rim on T2-weighted Brainstem Imaging is a Normal Finding and a Mimicker of Superficial Siderosis

## T2-weighted脑干成像上的低强度边缘是正常发现，并且是浅表含线病的模仿者。

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5695756/latest

Purpose: In healthy participants, T2 superficial localized low intensity (T2-SLL) similar to superficial siderosis has been observed in the brainstem. This study aimed to determine the incidence and causes of T2-SLL.
Methods: To determine the incidence, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) was performed on 114 patients (68 males; mean age: 59.1 years) using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner and visually assessed by two radiologists. T2-SLL presence in 22 brain areas was evaluated using the following system: 0 for absence, 1 for &amp;lt;50% surface, 2 for &ge;50% but not the entirety, and 3 for the entirety. After assessing inter-rater agreement, the scores were averaged. To investigate the causes of T2-SLL, an experimental MR imaging (MRI) was performed on a healthy male volunteer. To evaluate the chemical shift effect, the bandwidth and encoding direction were modified. To assess the magnetic susceptibility effect, T2*WI was performed using varying echo times (TEs).
Results: A moderate inter-rater score agreement (&kappa;=0.556) was observed. T2-SLL was identified in all participants and was most frequently observed on the frontal and lateral sides of the midbrain and pons, with the highest occurrence on the frontal of the upper pons (median 2.0; interquartile range 2.0&ndash;3.0). In the experimental MRI, no differences in T2-SLL were observed across the varying bandwidths and encoding directions. However, the superficial low signal for T2WI thickened as the TE lengthened, similar to blood vessels, suggesting a magnetic susceptibility effect.
Conclusion: T2-SLL can be regarded as a normal structure that may be associated with blood vessels.

摘要 (中文): 目的: 在健康参与者中，在脑干中观察到类似于浅表T2-SLL的T2浅表局部低强度 (siderosis)。本研究旨在确定T2-SLL的发生率和原因。
方法: 为了确定发生率，使用3.0磁共振 (MR) 扫描仪对114例患者 (68例男性; 平均年龄: 59.1岁) 进行了T2-weighted成像 (T2WI)，并由两名放射科医生进行了视觉评估。使用以下系统评估22个大脑区域中的T2-SLL存在: 0表示不存在，1表示 &lt;50% 表面，2表示 ≥ 50% 但不是整体，3表示整体。在评估评分者之间的一致性后，将分数平均。为了研究T2-SLL的原因，对健康的男性志愿者进行了实验性MR成像 (MRI)。为了评估化学位移效应，修改了带宽和编码方向。为了评估磁化率效应，使用不同的回波时间 (TEs) 进行T2 * WI。
结果: 观察到中度评分一致 (& kappa;= 0.556)。在所有参与者中都发现了T2-SLL，并且在中脑和脑桥的正面和侧面最常观察到，在上脑桥的正面发生率最高 (中位数2.0; 四分位间距2.0-3.0)。在实验MRI中，在不同的带宽和编码方向上没有观察到T2-SLL差异。然而，随着TE的延长，T2WI的浅表低信号变厚，类似于血管，提示磁化率效应。
结论: T2-SLL可以看作是一种可能与血管有关的正常结构。
