# Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices

Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.

# Evidence for a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid in the generalized Shastry-Sutherland model

Abstract: We present a multimethod investigation into the nature of the recently reported quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. A comprehensive projective symmetry group classification of fermionic mean-field Ans\"atze on this lattice yields 46 U(1) and 80 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ states. Motivated by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations suggesting that the Shastry-Sutherland model and the square-lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet putatively share the same QSL phase, we establish a mapping of our Ans\"atze to those of the square lattice. This enables us to identify the equivalent of the square-lattice QSL (Z2A$zz$13) in the Shastry-Sutherland system. Employing state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo calculations with Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions improved upon by Lanczos steps, we demonstrate the excellent agreement of energies and correlators between a gapless (Dirac) $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid -- characterized by only few parameters -- and approaches based on neural quantum states and DMRG. Furthermore, the real-space spin-spin correlations are shown to decay with the same power law as in the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ square lattice model, which also hosts a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. Finally, we apply the recently developed Keldysh formulation of the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group to compute the dynamical spin structure factor; these correlations exhibit the features expected due to Dirac cones in the excitation spectrum, thus providing strong independent evidence for a Dirac QSL ground state. Our finding of a $d$-wave pairing $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac QSL is consistent with the recently observed signatures of QSL behavior in Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ and outlines predictions for future experiments.

Abstract: Phase stabilization continues to be a critical issue in hafnium oxide (HfO$_2$) due to the interdependence of various contributing factors. Using first-principles calculations, we analyze the effects of strain and doping on stabilizing the ferroelectric phase. We found that combining Y-doping, O-vacancy, and compressive biaxial strain, particularly in the (111) orientation, offers an optimal pathway for stabilizing the ferroelectric phase of HfO$_2$. Analysis of structural coordination reveals how compressive strain affects phase competition. Crystallography analysis provides insights into the advantage of the (111) strain orientation compared to the (001) orientation. The impact of dopants is discussed in the context of these findings.

Abstract: Phonon polaritons are hybrid modes combining lattice dynamics and electromagnetic waves. Their behavior at long wavelengths is effectively described by Huang's equations. Here, we investigate phonon polaritons within 2D materials featuring twisted moir\'{e} structures. The interaction between electromagnetic waves and phonons of varying wavelengths gives rise to rich polaritons with moir\'{e} characteristics. We observe the polariton dividing into multiple branches, akin to coupled oscillators. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. A distinctive trait of moir\'{e} polar crystals is their spatially varying near-field response, offering robust signals for the experimental confirmation.

Abstract: We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. In the Voigt geometry, an ultrathin superconducting film is fully penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the condensate. We provide an alternative interpretation of the recent experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by Lee et al. [1] which describes better their data for magnetic field above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we analyze the terahertz conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions within a superconducting matrix. Moreover, we effectively account for ubiquitous pair-conserving and magnetic-field-dependent pair-breaking disorder scattering processes using the model of Herman and Hlubina [2].

Abstract: Patterned magnetic nanostructures are advanced materials characterized by their unique magnetic properties at the nanoscale, which are the result of tailored geometric configurations and compositional engineering. As interest in nanotechnology continues to grow exponentially, the exploration of patterned magnetic nanostructures turns into a vibrant and critical area of study for both industry professionals and academic researchers. Here, we review investigations of standing spin waves (collective spin precessions) in magnetic elements by the technique of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The presentation encompasses earlier studies of arrays of magnetic nanodisks and nanoringes by cavity-based FMR as well as more recent studies of individual nanodisks and 3D nanovolcanoes by a broadband FMR method which implies the use of a coplanar waveguide. Overall, the manuscript outlines the development of FMR studies along the two major lines: (i) downscaling from multiple to individual magnetic nanoelements and (ii) extending planar nanomagnets into the third dimension.

Abstract: Magnetic-free nonreciprocal optical devices that can prevent backscattering of signals are essential for integrated optical information processing. The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely on various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise to dispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatial broadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformation inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components for information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the nonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moir\'e photonic lattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or counter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two identical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output pattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localization in the forward case is derived from the moir\'e structure, and the nonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity) are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. The thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent condition for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case, because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the coupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the transverse beam profile in one-way transmission.

Abstract: In this study, the spin-orbit torque (SOT) in light metal oxide systems is investigated using an experimental approach based on harmonic Hall voltage techniques in out-of-plane (OOP) angular geometry for samples with in-plane magnetic anisotropy. In parallel, an analytical derivation of this alternative OOP harmonic Hall detection geometry has been developed, followed by experimental validation to extract SOT effective fields. In addition, to accurately quantifying SOT, this method allows complete characterization of thermoelectric effects, opening promising avenues for accurate SOT characterization in related systems. In particular, this study corroborates the critical role of naturally oxidized copper interfaced with metallic Cu in the generation of orbital current in Co(2)|Pt(4)|CuOx(3), demonstrating a two-fold increase in damping-like torques compared to a reference sample with an oxidized Al capping layer. These findings offer promising directions for future research on the application aspect of non-equilibrium orbital angular momentum.

Abstract: Molecular complexes are held together via a variety of bonds, but they all share the common feature that their individual entities are in contact. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate the concept of a \textit{molecular optical bond}, resulting from the far-field electromagnetic coupling of several molecules via a shared mode of an optical microcavity. We discuss a collective enhancement of the vacuum Rabi splitting and study super- and sub-radiant states that arise from the cavity-mediated coupling both in the resonant and dispersive regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate a two-photon transition that emerges between the ground and excited states of the new optical compound. Our experimental data are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and open the door to the realization of hybrid light-matter materials.

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state that has traits of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, has gained significant attention in the last few years and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the phenomenological models and group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary explanation of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explored the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and more realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principle calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, belonging to the hexagonal NiAs family (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.), we reveal that the second neighbor interaction between the orbitals of the non-magnetic atoms is the most deterministic in inducing altermagnetism. These second-neighbor bondings modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices. As a consequence, the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and it results in momentum dependent altermagnetic spin split (ASS). We further reveal that the strong altermagnetism is observed in these materials due to the participation of multiple and selective orbitals, both from Ni and S, in the chemical bonding. We proposed twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where ASS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, ASS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands it can go beyond 1eV, which makes this compound ideal for carrying out altermagnetic experiments and for exploring non-trivial quantum transport through electron and hole doping. The present study opens up new pathways to tailor tunable altermagnetism.

Three-dimensional (3D) topological materials are characterized by robust electronic states that are protected by symmetries and exhibit peculiar spin textures. They offer a rich platform for for future information technology including spintronics and topological quantum computing. Here, we review the investigation by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) of topological phases such as strong topological insulators, topological crystalline insulators, magnetic topological insulators, and 3D Dirac, Weyl, nodal, and chiral semimetals and address the status of correlated topological insulators and topological superconductors. A special emphasis is laid on examples from the transition metal dichalcogenide family. Moreover, insights from ultrafast pump-probe experiments are reviewed and a brief outlook is provided.

Abstract: This paper analyzes a peculiar phenomenon of non-reciprocal domain wall pairs and illustrate the implications in ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments with (112)-oriented planar R180 domain walls within the canonical multiferroic ferroelectric crystal of BiFeO3. Results show that parallel walls on the opposite sides of a given domain within a simply twinned lamellar domain structure can have considerably different polarization and oxygen octahedra tilt profiles, different thickness and energy densities. The spontaneous formation of zigzag walls and triangular domains suggests that these domain walls are actually the lowest energy planar R180 walls in pure insulating BiFeO3 crystals and films.

Abstract: In Co$_x$NbSe$_2$, crystal symmetry, and cobalt site occupation drive the formation of two distinct magnetic phases. At $x = 1/4$, the centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$/$mmc$) promotes Co-Co interactions leading to the formation of an $A$-type antiferromagnetic structure phase with a transition temperature of $T_N^A$ = 169 K. At $x = 1/3$, the non-centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$22) induces a lower-temperature magnetic phase with $T_N^S$ = 28 K. We report the coexistence of both substructures within a superlattice, with a nuclear propagation vector of (1/3, 1/3, 0) relative to the host lattice. Single crystals of Co$_{0.28}$NbSe$_2$ exhibit both magnetic transitions, with $T_N^A$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/4$ phase and $T_N^S$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/3$ phase. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements confirm these transitions, although only the high-temperature $T_N^A$ phase significantly affects resistivity. We successfully isolate each phase in powder samples, while single crystals with an intercalation ratio of $x = 0.28$ display the coexistence of both phases in a single sample. Using single-crystal neutron diffraction, we solved the magnetic structure of the high-temperature centrosymmetric phase ($T_N^A$), and neutron powder diffraction revealed the double-$q$ magnetic structure of the low-temperature noncentrosymmetric phase ($T_N^S$)

Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses is a mainstream in studies of of dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as it happens e.g. in organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground syate ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt for the phase transition a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor which appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state which then evolves interacting with other degrees of freedom prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains which evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.

Our findings unveil multiple multidomain configurations and illustrate how the different order parameters evolve towards the surface. Interestingly, for neutral terminations, a non-rhombohedral phase of BiFeO$_3$ with a stripe-like polarization arrangement was stabilized. We evaluate the polarization, oxygen octahedra rotation, and volume variation for all the configurations obtained, taking advantage of the atomic-scale details provided by the methods used in this study.

Abstract: The Hebel-Slichter coherence peak, observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ just below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, serves as a crucial experimental validation of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing symmetry in conventional superconductors. However, no coherence peak in $1/T_1$ has been observed in unconventional superconductors like cuprates. In this study, an unconventional coherence peak is identified for the first time using nuclear quadrupole resonance on YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, pointing to a distinctive pairing symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance with nuclear spin $I>1/2$ comprises the magnetic relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, which probes magnetic fluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm quad}$, which probes charge fluctuations. By utilizing $^{63}$Cu and $^{65}$Cu isotopes, we successfully distinguish $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$ and $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ and reveal the presence of the coherence peak in $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ but not in $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, in contrast to conventional superconductors. Our finding demonstrates that unconventional superconductors do not exhibit a coherence peak in $1/T_{1}$ when the relaxation is due to fluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a coherence peak is expected when the relaxation is caused by electric field gradient fluctuations, due to the different coherence factors between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our successful measurements of $1/T_{1}$ for the chains of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ suggest that, should the conditions for predominant quadrupole relaxation be satisfied, this phenomenon could provide a novel approach to exploring the unconventional nature of the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.

Abstract: According to the theory of group representations, the types of band degeneracy can be divided into accidental degeneracy and essential degeneracy. The essentially degenerate nodal lines (NLs) are typically resided on the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. Here, we propose a type of NL in two dimension that is essentially degenerate but is hidden within the high-symmetry planes, making it less observable, dubbed a hidden-essential nodal line (HENL). The existence of HENL is guaranteed as long as the system hosts a horizontal glide-mirror symmetry, hence such NLs can be widely found in both non-magnetic and magnetic systems. We perform an exhaustive search over all 528 magnetic layer groups (MLGs) for HENL that can be enforced by glide-mirror symmetry with both spinless and spinfull systems. We find that 122 candidate MLGs host spinless HENL, while 63 candidate MLGs demonstrate spinful HENL. In addition, we reveal that horizontal mirror and time-reversal symmetry in type-II and type-IV MLGs with spin-orbital coupling can enforce HENL formed. The 15 corresponding candidate MLGs have also been presented. Furthemore, we derive a few typical lattice models to characterize the existence for the HENL. For specific electronic fillings in real materials, namely 4$N$+2 in spinless systems (and 2$N$+1 in spinful systems), the presence of the HENLs in candidate MLGs is required regardless of the details of the systems. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations, we further identify possible material candidates that realize spinless and spinful HENL. Moreover, spinful HENLs exhibit a novel persistent spin texture wih the characteristic of momentum-independent spin configuration. Our findings uncover a new type of topological semimetal state and offer an ideal platform to study the related physics of HENLs.

Abstract: Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization and for the spin-orbit torque devices. In this study, we investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3d ferromagnetic metals including spin-orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L10-MnAl as an example. By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3d ferromagnetic metals are at the order of 1000 \frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1} at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin Hall angles around 0.01~0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity. For L10-MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach up to 10000\frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1}, with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization without an external magnetic field by using 3d ferromagnetic metals as spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding on spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their potential applications in related spintronic devices.

# Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions

arXiv:2501.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, the highest value reported to date. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.

Abstract: Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), the variation in resistance in a heavy metal (HM) with the magnetization orientation of an adjacent ferromagnet (FM), has been extensively studied as a powerful tool for probing surface magnetic moments in a variety of magnetic materials. However, the conventional SMR theory assumes rigid magnetization of a fixed magnitude, an assumption that breaks down close to the FM's Curie temperature \(T_c\), where the magnetic susceptibility diverges. Here, we report an unconventional SMR effect arising from the magnetic-field modulation of spin fluctuations in the FM, while its magnetization remaining collinear to the spin Hall accumulation in the HM. In contrast to the conventional SMR, which scales with the magnetization and vanishes near $T_{c}$, such ``longitudinal" SMR (LSMR), though suppressed at low temperatures, becomes critically enhanced at \(T_c\), reaching a magnitude comparable to conventional SMR amplitudes. Our findings suggest a promising method for electrically detecting enhanced spin fluctuations in magnetic systems.

arXiv:2501.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the nonreciprocity of superconducting critical currents for the metal-superconductor transition. Generally, the SDE has a positive and a negative critical current $j_{c\pm}$ corresponding to two opposite directions whose amplitudes are unequal. It is demonstrated that an extreme nonreciprocity where two critical currents can become both positive (or negative) has been observed in a recent experiment. In this work, we theoretically propose a possible mechanism to realize an extreme nonreciprocal SDE. Based on a microscopic theory and a simple valley-polarized model, we demonstrate that depairing currents required to dissolve Cooper pairs can be remodulated under the interplay between the valley polarization and the applied current. Near the disappearance of the superconductivity, the remodulation is shown to induce the extreme nonreciprocity and also the current-induced re-entrant superconductivity where the system has two different critical current intervals. Our study may provide new horizons for understanding the coexistence of superconductivity and spontaneous ferromagnetism and pave a new way to designing the SDE with 100% efficiency.

Abstract: We report on magnetic anisotropy modulation in Bismuth substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Bi-YIG) thin films and mesoscale patterned structures deposited on a PMN-PT substrate with the application of voltage-induced strain. The Bi content is selected for low coercivity and higher magnetostriction than that of YIG, yielding significant changes in the hysteresis loops through the magnetoelastic effect. The piezoelectric substrate is poled along its thickness, which is the [011] direction, by applying a voltage across the PMN-PT/SiO2/Bi-YIG/Pt heterostructure. In-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (MOKE) shows the modulation of magnetic anisotropy with voltage-induced strain. Furthermore, voltage control of the magnetic domain state of the Bi-YIG film at a fixed magnetic field produces a 90{\deg} switching of the magnetization easy axis above a threshold voltage. The magnetoelectric coefficient of the heterostructure is 1.05x10^(-7)s/m which is competitive with that of other ferromagnetic oxide films on ferroelectric substrates such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/PMNPT and YIG/PMN-PZT. Voltage-control of magnetization reversal fields in 5-30 microns wide dots and racetracks of Bi-YIG show potential for energy efficient non-volatile memory and neuromorphic computing devices.

Abstract: Magnetic kagome metals have garnered considerable attention as an ideal platform for investigating intrinsic topological structures, frustrated magnetism, and electron correlation effects. In this work, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$, a metal that features a niobium-based kagome lattice and a frustrated triangular gadolinium network. The compound adopts the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type crystal structure, with lattice parameters of a = b = 5.765(4) {\AA} and c = 9.536(8) {\AA}. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements reveal a magnetic transition near 2.3 K. Electrical transport data confirm metallic behavior, unsaturated positive magnetoresistance, and a hole-dominated multiband Hall effect. Furthermore, first-principles calculations indicate that Nb-4d orbitals predominantly contribute to the electronic states near the Fermi energy, with the band structure showing multiple topologically nontrivial crossings around the Fermi surface. This study also compares GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$ with GdV$_6$Sn$_6$, highlighting their similarities and differences. Our findings pave the way for exploring RNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = rare earth) with customized substitutions of R sites to fine-tune their properties.

Abstract: We study the two-dimensional square lattice Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet with a magnetic field by using tensor network method. Focusing on the role of guage fixing, we present the partition function in terms of a tensor network. The tensor has a different symmetry property for ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The tensor network of the partition function is interpreted as a multiple product of the one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian. We perform infinite density matrix renormalization group to contract the two-dimensional tensor network. We present the numerical result of magnetization and entanglement entropy for the Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet side by side. In order to determine the critical line in the parameter space of temperature and magnetic field, we use the half-chain entanglement entropy of the one-dimensional quantum state. The entanglement entropy precisely indicates the critical line forming the parabolic shape for the antiferromagnetic case, but shows the critical point for the ferromagnetic case.

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.

Abstract: We investigate how spatiotemporal spin polarized current can lead to terahertz frequency excitations in non-collinear antiferromagnets. By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically for non-collinear antiferromagnet, we show that the magnon frequency spectrum exhibits standing spin wave modes and depends on the thickness of Mn$_3$Ge in heterostructure Fe|Au|Mn$_3$Ge. Also, we analyze the switching process of ground state as a function of a spin current. We show a switching phase diagram, which contains switching and non-switching regions. Our work suggests non-collinear antiferromagnets as an efficient platform for terahertz magnonics and ultrafast memory devices.

Abstract: Spin coupling between magnetic metal atoms and organic radicals plays a pivotal role in high-performance magnetic materials. The complex interaction involving multi-spin centers in bulk materials makes it challenging to study spin coupling at the atomic scale. Here, we investigate the $d$-$\pi$-$d$ spin interaction in well-defined metal-organic coordinated structures composed of two iron (Fe) atoms and four all-trans retinoic acid (ReA) molecules, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The ReA molecule is turned into a spin-$1/2$ radical state by dehydrogenation, facilitating strong magnetic coupling with the coordinated Fe atoms. Comprehensive theoretical analysis, based on density functional theory and valence bond theory, further elucidates the intrinsic mechanism of ferrimagnetic spin coupling in the coordination structure. Specifically, simultaneous antiferromagnetic coupling of Fe dimer to ReA radicals parallelizes the dimer spin orientation. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of spin interaction in metal-organic coordination structures and provides microscopic insights for designing advanced magnetic materials.

Abstract: Waveguides are fundamental components for signal transmission in integrated wave-based processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with designing magnonic waveguides and propose a novel type with promising properties. Specifically, we study a magnonic waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$) through surface anisotropy applied in stripe regions, creating Bragg mirror structures. The proposed waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while avoiding static demagnetizing effects. Using finite element simulations, we calculate the dispersion relation of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial profiles. Additionally, we evaluate the group velocity and localization characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the waveguide's performance.

Abstract: Understanding the formation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials is a problem of fundamental and technological interest. GdRu2Si2 is one such candidate material which has been shown to host a variety of multi-Q magnetic structures, including in zero-field. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used to measure the spin excitations in the field-polarized phase of GdRu2Si2. Linear spin wave theory and a method of interaction invariant path analysis are used to derive a Hamiltonian accounting for the observed spectra, and comparisons to \textit{ab initio} calculations are made. No evidence for anisotropic or higher order-exchange terms beyond bilinear Heisenberg exchange is found. This is discussed in the context of the multi-Q states existing at lower fields, for which these types of terms have previously been conceived to be significant in the formation of multi-Q ground states.

Abstract: We report on the electron spin resonance (ESR), heat capacity, magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic circular and linear dichroism (XMCD, XMLD), as well as the electrical resistivity of EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ single crystals. Antiferromagnetic order of Eu was observed in several quantities at $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}\,=\,18\,\rm K$. The temperature dependencies of ESR linewidth and resonance shift show, when approaching the Eu-ordered state, a divergence towards $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}$, indicating the growing importance of magnetic correlations and the build-up of internal magnetic fields. An additional temperature scale of $\approx 47\,\rm K$ has considerable impact on linewidth, resonance field and intensity. This points to the presence of weak Mn-based ordering. The observed ESR line is interpreted as an Eu$^{2+}$ resonance, which probes the weak magnetic background of the Mn subsystem. Such picture is suggested by the lineshape which keeps to be Lorentzian across the $47\,\rm K$ scale and by the ESR intensity which can be described by the same Curie-Weiss temperature above and below $47\,\rm K$. In the same temperature range anomalies were observed at $48.5\,\rm K$ and $51\,\rm K$ in the heat capacity data as well as a pronounced broadening of the NMR signal of the EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ samples. In XMCD and XMLD measurements, this weak magnetic order could not be detected in the same temperature range which might be due to the small magnetic moment, with a potential $c$-component or frustration.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.

arXiv:2501.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-field magnetic noise, characterised by the magnetic autocorrelation function $S_s(t)$, has been observed, perhaps surprisingly, to depend on sample shape $s$. The reasons for this are identified and general expressions are derived that relate the autocorrelation functions for systems of different shape to an underlying `intrinsic' form. Assuming the flcutuatiopn-dissipation theorem, it is shown that, for any noise that relaxes monotonically, the effect of sample shape is to reduce both the noise amplitude and mean relaxation time by a factor of $1+N\chi_i$, where $N$ is the demagnetizing factor and $\chi_i$ the intrinsic susceptibility. In frequency space, where $S_s(t)$ Fourier transforms into the power spectrum $S_s(\omega)$, the above two factors combine to suppress the zero frequency amplitude of $S_s(\omega)$ by $(1+N\chi_i)^2$, while at high frequency, sample shape dependence becomes negligible. These results suggest simple and robust experimental tests of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem in magnetic systems that may be useful in distinguishing bulk from surface effects.

Abstract: We present a fully analytical model of hybridization between magnon, and phonons observed experimentally in magneto-Raman scattering in van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (AFM). Here, the representative material, FePS3, has been shown to be a quasi-two-dimensional-Ising antiferromagnet, with additional features of spin-phonon coupling in the Raman spectra emerging below the N\'eel temperature (TN) of approximately 120 K. Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy as an optical probe of magnetic structure, we show that one of these Raman-active modes in the magnetically ordered state is a magnon with a frequency of 3.7 THz (~ 122 cm-1). In addition, one magnon band and three phonon bands are coupled via the magneto-elastic coupling evidenced by anti-crossing in the complete spectra. We consider a simple model involving only in-plane nearest neighbor exchange couplings (designed to give rise to a similar magnetic structure) and perpendicular anisotropy in presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field. Exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian leads to energy bands which show that the interaction term gives rise to avoided crossings between the hybridized magnon and phonon branches. Realizing magnon-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) AFMs is important for the verification of the theoretical predictions on exotic quantum transport phenomena like spin-caloritronics, topological magnonics, etc.

Abstract: A general analytical approach to the study of electromagnetic resonances of metasurfaces consisting of meta-atoms with anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities and irradiated with obliquely incident light is developed in the direct dipole-moment representation. The presented approach allows us to clearly trace and explain the features of the electromagnetic coupling between electric and magnetic dipole moments in the metasurface and to identify its role in the formation of optical resonances. For these purposes, the dependence of the dipole lattice sums on the angle of illumination is also presented. Expressions for the transmittance and reflectivity corresponding to the specular reflectance are presented with explicit inclusion of the dipole moments of particles in the array, which allows using these expressions for multipole analysis of purely numerical results concerning the optical response of metasurfaces. The developed analytical method is tested to characterize the spectral resonances of dielectric metasurfaces composed of rectangular silicon nanoprisms. In addition, we discuss the relationship and similarity between the results of coupled dipole and coupled dipole-quadrupole methods. Our analytical representation of electromagnetic dipole coupling is an insightful and fast method for the characterization of collective resonances in metasurfaces under illumination at oblique incidence. It could be especially useful for designing planar nanophotonic devices consisting of arbitrary-shaped building blocks and operating under special irradiation conditions.

Abstract: The tricritical behavior in a class of one-dimensional (1D) field theories that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero temperature and chemical potential is analyzed. In the Gross-Neveu (GN)-type models of massless fermions the discrete chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. After doping, the symmetry is restored at a critical chemical potential. We investigate the temperature effects on this doped 1D system under an external constant Zeeman magnetic field $B_0$. We find that $B_0$ suppresses the gapless behavior present for certain values of chemical potential and is able to induce a gapless-gapped phase transition at a critical field strength. We also discuss about the consequences of the consideration of inhomogeneous condensates to the tricritical point, within the Ginzburg-Landau expansion.

Abstract: Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model for a tunable coherent terahertz radiation source based on the long-lived Bose condensate of photons. In the device we propose, the original photon pumping is performed incoherently by a blackbody radiation emitter. The photons thus produced Bose-condense by the inelastic relaxation on a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetostatic field. The process involves neither population inversion nor light wave amplification the standard laser sources are built on. The coherence and tunability of the light emitted by such a photon condensate are provided and supported by the discrete spectrum of the electron gas in the quantizing magnetic field. The device is a compact-size semiconductor crystal. We propose the design and perform the realistic calculations of the physical properties and limiting factors for the terahertz photon Bose-condensate resonator. We show that our terahertz source can deliver the highly coherent light emission in the frequency range of 3-30 THz for the magnetic field induction of the order of 2 T, with the upper emission frequency limit adjustable by the strength of the magnetic field applied.

Abstract: The emergence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL), a state of matter that can result when electron spins are highly correlated but do not become ordered, has been the subject of a considerable body of research in condensed matter physics. Spin liquid states have been proposed as hosts for high-temperature superconductivity and can host topological properties with potential applications in quantum information science. The excitations of most quantum spin liquids are not conventional spin waves but rather quasiparticles known as spinons, whose existence is well established experimentally only in one-dimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL behavior in higher dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate the novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective spin-1/2 moments with no detectable inherent chemical disorder. Thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on high-quality single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.06 K, demonstrate a quadratic power law for the specific heat and reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations in parts of the Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and inelastic neutron scattering spectra suggest that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with spinon excitations concentrated at certain points in the Brillouin zone. We advanced these results by performing additional specific heat measurements under finite fields, further confirming the theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular lattice of YbZn2GaO5.

Abstract: We present a bunch of novel phenomena stemming from the pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI), which does not rely on structure inversion asymmetry but instead arises from Coulomb fields of interacting electrons in materials with a strong Rashba effect. First, PSOI can induce $p-$wave superconducting order without the need for any mediators of attraction. Depending on the sign and strength of the PSOI coupling, two distinct superconducting phases emerge in 3D systems, analogous to the A and B phases observed in superfluid $^3\mathrm{He}$. In contrast, 2D systems exhibit $p^x\pm i p^y$ order parameter, leading to the time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity. Second, a sufficiently strong PSOI can induce ferromagnetic ordering. It is associated with a deformation of the Fermi surface, which eventually leads to a Lifshitz transition from a spherical to a toroidal Fermi surface, with a number of experimentally observable signatures. Finally, in sufficiently clean Rashba materials, ferromagnetism and $p-$wave superconductivity may coexist. This state resembles the $\mathrm{A}_1$ phase of $^3\mathrm{He}$, yet it may avoid nodal points due to the toroidal shape of the Fermi surface.

Abstract: The Hubbard model at temperatures above the N\'{e}el transition, despite being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover regime, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the Fermi liquid for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the location of the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methodology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can also serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.

Abstract: We present the first detailed study of the effect of a strong magnetic field on single-electron pumping in a device utilising a finger-gate split-gate configuration. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate electron pumping from Landau levels in the leads, where the measurements exhibit pronounced oscillations in the lengths of the pumping plateaus with the magnetic field, reminiscent of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This similarity indicates that the pumping process is dependent on the density of states of the 2D electron gas over a narrow energy window. Based on these observations, we develop a new theoretical description of the operation of single-electron pumps which for the first time allows for the determination of the physical parameters of the experiment; such as the capture energy of the electrons, the broadening of the quantised Landau levels in the leads, and the quantum lifetime of the electrons.

Abstract: Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.

Abstract: A wide family of two dimensional (2D) systems, including stripe-phase superconductors, sliding Luttinger liquids, and anisotropic 2D materials, can be modeled by an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) electron channels or nanowire arrays. Here we report experiments in arrays of conducting nanowires with gate and field tunable interwire coupling, that are programmed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.

Abstract: We theoretically investigated the chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals recently discovered in van der Waals structures of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. These chiral phonons can emerge under the inversion symmetry breaking introduced by an effective mass imbalance between the two layers or a moir\'e potential in one layer, as well as under the time-reversal symmetry breaking realized by applying a magnetic field. Considering the wide tunability of layered materials, the frequencies and chirality values of phonons can both be tuned by varying the system parameters. These findings suggest that bilayer honeycomb-type Wigner crystals can serve as an exciting new platform for studying chiral phonons.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of orbital current arising from orbital Hall effect in thin films of Nb and Ti in ohmic contact with ferromagnetic Ni in the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltages in response to an a.c. current applied to the bilayer structures. Our experiments were analogous to those on Heavy Metal-Ferromagnet bilayers and we extract the Orbital Hall Torque efficiency and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.

Abstract: Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer pathways for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can be used to create robust nano-oscillators for neuromorphic computing. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and device level spin-pumping FMR measurements are performed to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films ranging from 300K to 90K and compare the device performance with Py(7 nm)/Pt(5 nm) sample. The spin current pumped into Pt is quantified to determine the temperature dependent influence of interfacial interactions. The generated spin current in the micro-device is maximum at 170K for the optimally grown LSMO/Pt films. Additionally, this bilayer system exhibits low magnetic Gilbert damping (0.002), small linewidth (12 Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ($\approx$ 3.2%) at 170K. By fine-tuning the LSMO/Pt interface quality and integrating it into the device structure, the system exhibits a fourfold enhancement in signal output for LSMO/Pt devices compared to the Pt/Py system. Such robust device level performance can pave way for energy-efficient spintronic based devices.

Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.

Abstract: The recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of materials with intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures. For the AB-stacking heterostructures that are semiconducting, ferrimagnetic-type spin splitting emerges, and the fully compensated magnetization is protected by the Luttinger theorem. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP$_2$S$_6$, MnPX$_3$-based heterostructures can show tunable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on the electronic band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.

Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.

Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.

Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.

Abstract: A general analytical approach to the study of electromagnetic resonances of metasurfaces consisting of meta-atoms with anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities and irradiated with obliquely incident light is developed in the direct dipole-moment representation. The presented approach allows us to clearly trace and explain the features of the electromagnetic coupling between electric and magnetic dipole moments in the metasurface and to identify its role in the formation of optical resonances. For these purposes, the dependence of the dipole lattice sums on the angle of illumination is also presented. Expressions for the transmittance and reflectivity corresponding to the specular reflectance are presented with explicit inclusion of the dipole moments of particles in the array, which allows using these expressions for multipole analysis of purely numerical results concerning the optical response of metasurfaces. The developed analytical method is tested to characterize the spectral resonances of dielectric metasurfaces composed of rectangular silicon nanoprisms. In addition, we discuss the relationship and similarity between the results of coupled dipole and coupled dipole-quadrupole methods. Our analytical representation of electromagnetic dipole coupling is an insightful and fast method for the characterization of collective resonances in metasurfaces under illumination at oblique incidence. It could be especially useful for designing planar nanophotonic devices consisting of arbitrary-shaped building blocks and operating under special irradiation conditions.

Abstract: The ST2 center is an optically addressable point defect in diamond that facilitates spin initialization and readout. However, while this study presents the discovery of ST2 centers first observed in a natural diamond and provides a reliable technique for artificially creating them, its chemical structure remains unknown. To assess the potential of ST2, we map out its basic optical characteristics, reveal its electronic level structure, and quantify the intrinsic transition rates. Furthermore, we investigate its response to microwaves, static magnetic fields, and the polarization of excitation laser light, revealing twelve inequivalent orientations of the ST2 center. Simultaneous exposure to microwaves and static magnetic fields also reveals an exceptionally wide acceptance angle for sensing strong magnetic fields, unlike the well-established NV center, which is sensitive only within a narrow cone aligned with its symmetry axis. This finding establishes the ST2 center as a highly promising candidate for nanoscale quantum sensing.

Abstract: We propose an approach to extracting equivalent circuit models for waveguide-fed, resonant metamaterial elements, such as the complementary, electric inductive-capacitive element (cELC). From the scattering parameters of a single waveguide-fed cELC, effective electric and magnetic polarizabilities can be determined that can be expressed in terms of equivalent lumped element circuit components. The circuit model provides considerable insight into the electromagnetic scattering properties of cELCs as a function of their geometric parameters and imparts intuition useful for element optimization. We find that planar, inherently resonant, waveguide-fed elements exhibit a set of common properties that place constraints on their coupling, maximum radiation, and other key scattering parameters. In addition, unlike simple slots and other non-resonant irises, resonant elements introduce an effective transformer to the equivalent circuit that accounts for the field enhancement occurring in such elements at resonance. We introduce a general and robust method to determine the effective circuit parameters by fitting to the extracted polarizability, extending the approach to resonant metamaterial elements integrated with physical lumped circuit components, such as packaged capacitors or varactors. We find excellent agreement between the analytical predictions and full-wave simulations, such that with one or two full-wave simulations the properties of the cELC can be determined for any externally added lumped elements. This approach can be leveraged to dramatically increase the efficiency of metasurface aperture design, especially when libraries of element responses are required.

Abstract: Turbulence driven by gyrokinetic instabilities is largely responsible for transport in magnetic fusion devices. To estimate this turbulent transport, integrated modeling codes often use mixing length estimates in conjunction with reduced models of the linearized gyrokinetic equation. One common method of formulating and solving the linearized gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem equation uses a Ritz variational principle, particularly in the local collisionless limit. However, the variational principle as typically stated in the literature is mathematically incorrect. In this work, we derive a mathematically correct form of the variational principle that applies to local linear collisionless gyrokinetics in general geometry with electromagnetic effects. We also explicitly derive a weak form of the gyrokinetic field equations suitable for numerical applications.

arXiv:2501.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have introduced and studied the feasibility of a hybrid solid liquid vibration energy harvester. The energy harvester consists of a ferrofluid partially filled in a tank and a piezoelectric beam fixed at one of the tank walls. The tank is assumed to be placed in a nonuniform magnetic field created by placing two powerful magnets symmetrically external to the tank walls. This magnetic field was then implemented by a Magnetic field function modeling the magnetic field produced by the two magnets. We used piezoelectric beam configurations and oscillation loads to study and characterize this 2D multiscale, multiphysics, and multiphase fluid structure interaction. The tank is subjected to an external oscillatory motion, which sloshes the ferrofluid and oscillates the beam utilizing two modes, one due to the beams inertia and the second due to the impact of the ferrofluid on the beam. The parameters varied in piezo materials, ferrofluid fill height, piezoelectric beam length, and oscillation frequency. The natural frequency modes for the piezoelectric beam are very important since the beam harvests the highest power in those modes. We have observed that when the fluid motion vibrates the beam, in some instances, the voltage output from piezoelectric material peaks to a high value, which is indicative of material nearing resonance frequencies at the fluid loading realized in those instances. However, in other cases, the voltage output varies with the loading, and hence, the response of the piezoelectric beam is broadband, very similar to the sloshing, which is inherently broadband.

Abstract: Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.

Abstract: The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN is used to study the production of new particles in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV. The detector includes a magnet based on a 6 m diameter superconducting coil operating at a current of 18.164 kA. This current creates a central magnetic flux density of 3.8 T that allows for the high-precision measurement of the momenta of the produced charged particles using tracking and muon subdetectors. The CMS magnet contains a 10,000 ton flux-return yoke made from the construction steel blocks. These blocks are magnetized, with the coil returned magnetic flux and wrap the muons escaping the hadronic calorimeters. To describe the distribution of the magnetic flux in the magnet yoke layers, a three-dimensional computer model of the CMS magnet is used. To validate the calculations, special measurements are performed, with the flux loops wound in 22 cross-sections of the flux-return yoke blocks. The measured voltages induced in the flux loops during the CMS magnet current variations, are integrated over time to obtain the initial magnetic flux densities in the flux loop cross-sections. In the last time, three fast discharges occurred during the standard ramp-downs of the magnet. This allows us to single out the contributions of the eddy currents, induced in steel, to the flux loop voltages. Accounting for these contributions to the flux loop measurements during intentionally triggered fast discharges in 2006 allows us to perform the validation of the CMS magnet computer model with better precision. The technique for the flux loop measurements and the obtained results are presented and discussed. The method for measuring magnetic flux density in steel blocks described in this study is innovative.

Abstract: We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\approx 500 {\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19{\deg} E05{\deg}). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of {\pounds} -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19{\deg}.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24{\deg}. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|{\deg} for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10{\deg}. 0|--|19{\deg}. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17{\deg}. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.{\deg}2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25{\deg}.1 \pm 0{\deg}.5 ILAT and -949 \pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27{\deg}.1 ILAT and -907 \pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.

Abstract: We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.

Abstract: Phonon polaritons are hybrid modes combining lattice dynamics and electromagnetic waves. Their behavior at long wavelengths is effectively described by Huang's equations. Here, we investigate phonon polaritons within 2D materials featuring twisted moir\'{e} structures. The interaction between electromagnetic waves and phonons of varying wavelengths gives rise to rich polaritons with moir\'{e} characteristics. We observe the polariton dividing into multiple branches, akin to coupled oscillators. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. A distinctive trait of moir\'{e} polar crystals is their spatially varying near-field response, offering robust signals for the experimental confirmation.

Abstract: Magnetic-free nonreciprocal optical devices that can prevent backscattering of signals are essential for integrated optical information processing. The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely on various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise to dispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatial broadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformation inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components for information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the nonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moir\'e photonic lattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or counter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two identical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output pattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localization in the forward case is derived from the moir\'e structure, and the nonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity) are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. The thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent condition for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case, because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the coupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the transverse beam profile in one-way transmission.

Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses is a mainstream in studies of of dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as it happens e.g. in organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground syate ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt for the phase transition a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor which appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state which then evolves interacting with other degrees of freedom prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains which evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.

Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional depolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is focused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking scattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are inconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$ polarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost complete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms H~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We utilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the electronic states $X ^1\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT code to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the resulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions for the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these collisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical expressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total molecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines, rather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of neglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$ lines.

Abstract: The Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology is currently a preferred choice for neutrino experiments and beyond the standard model physics searches such as nucleon decay and dark matter. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will employ the LArTPC technology at a large scale for physics programs, benefiting from its large target mass and excellent imaging, tracking, and particle identification capabilities. In DUNE, accurate energy reconstruction is important for precisely measuring CP violation, determining neutrino mass ordering and fully utilising the detector's potential. The energy calibration techniques developed for the DUNE far detector (FD) horizontal drift are presented here, utilising stopping cosmic-ray muons and validating the methods with the stopping pions and protons. The study demonstrates the versatility of the calibration techniques, applicable to other LArTPC, and valid for different particles. The electromagnetic shower energy reconstruction from $\pi^{0} \rightarrow 2\gamma$ events and the subsequent reconstruction of $\pi^{0}$ mass are also presented. These are important calibrations which address the measurement of energy loss in the DUNE FD volume and are critical for achieving the exciting physics goals of the experiment.

Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic fields of exoplanets affect the structure of their atmospheres and plasmaspheres and, therefore, the observational manifestations of transit absorptions. This work proposes a new method for constraining the presence or absence of relatively weak magnetic fields. The method is based on the quantum effect of atomic alignment of the lower energy level resulting in changing the absorption probabilities of individual transitions of multiplets from the equilibrium 2J+1 value. It appears to be sensitive to fields above ~0.001 G. We applied this method to some available transit observations of exoplanets and demonstrate that we indeed have the possibility to constrain the intrinsic magnetic field of some exoplanets right now. However, more precise and repetitive measurements, which might be available in near future, are needed for definite conclusions.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.

Abstract: A thoughtless treatment of Maxwell's equations can lead to the interpretation of the existence of a causal relationship between their different terms and, therefore, that an electric field that varies in time generates a magnetic one and vice versa. In this article we address the problems associated with these interpretations and their consequences for the teaching of physics in introductory university physics courses. First, we develop the main arguments that support that charge and current densities, constant or variable in time, are the generators of electric and magnetic fields. Then, we propose a number of classroom examples at the level of introductory courses that allow us to discuss the reasons why considering the electric and magnetic fields as disjoint entities leads to contradictions. Finally, we analyze their implications in introductory physics teaching.

Abstract: Most recently, a brand new optical phenomenon, collectively induced transparency (CIT) has already been proposed in the cavity quantum electrodynamics system, which comes from the coupling between the cavity and ions and the quantum interference of collective ions. In this paper, we propose the CIT in terahertz (THz) metamaterial device by employing the coupling between bright mode and interference of dark modes for the first time. We give the theoretical analysis, analytical calculations and simulations to present the transmission spectrum of CIT metamaterials. Furthermore, we can observe the tendency of CIT's transmission spectrum by experiments which well verify our idea. Ideal CIT metamaterial device can produce a very high Q peak in the middle of transmission spectrum of Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which can be useful for highly sensitive metamaterial sensors, optical switches and photo-memory.

Abstract: Localized optical field enhancement enables strong light-matter interactions necessary for efficient manipulation and sensing of light. Specifically, tunable broadband energy localization in nanoscale hotspots offers a wide range of applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics. We experimentally demonstrate a novel principle for the local enhancement of electromagnetic fields, based on strong suppression of backscattering. This is achieved at a designed termination of a topologically non-trivial waveguide that nearly preserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley degree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at waveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using near-field microscopy, we reveal that this can lead to strong confinement of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We emphasize the importance of symmetry conservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries, confirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the near-conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth of the effect.

Abstract: A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level magnetic fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a uniform and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and tunable field configuration is useful for 2-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. In this work, by aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) to the zero-field line of a 2-foil-based planar 2D-MOT, we demonstrate field-free operation of the quantum optical interface in a quasi-continuous manner, without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy is performed with a measurement repetition rate as high as 250~kHz. An anomalous line broadening is observed, which is not fully understood, but is partly explained by a small residual field along the zero-field line. Through additional field measurements and simulations, we clarify that this residual field can be eliminated in an $n$=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap to support efficient sub-Doppler cooling and uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long field-free distances $l$. With the strong field gradient to support atom guiding, the ferromagnetic device may also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons.

Abstract: The recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of materials with intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures. For the AB-stacking heterostructures that are semiconducting, ferrimagnetic-type spin splitting emerges, and the fully compensated magnetization is protected by the Luttinger theorem. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP$_2$S$_6$, MnPX$_3$-based heterostructures can show tunable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on the electronic band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.

**Authors:** Primadi, Subintoro

Molecular spin qubits based on molecules that feature accessible atomic clock transitions have demonstrated immense potential in quantum information science research, and exemplary in this regard is the holmium polyoxometalate, [Na9Ho(W5O18)2]•35H2O (HoW10). The coherence time of this molecule is limited by spin-phonon coupling driven decoherence processes, and one route to overcome this limitation is to increase the magnetic anisotropy of the metal included within the polyoxometalate (POM) complex. Herein we conducted a full investigation into the fundamental structural and vibrational properties of Lindqvist POMs that include uranium (IV), which also feature MJ = ± 4 ground states, similar to Ho(III) in HoW10. Based on recent results from our group that demonstrated the importance of the secondary lattice elements in tuning the distortion of the D4d symmetry in W10 POM complexes, we synthesized eight UW10 complexes with different alkali metal counterions and evaluated how the composition and packing of counterion species affected complex structural and vibrational properties Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis on complexes 1-8 revealed changes in structural distortion parameters, i.e., skew angle, plane angle, and plane distance, as a function of differences in counterion configurations. Far-infrared and Raman spectra for 1-8 also demonstrated that vibrational mode frequencies [ν(WO5)2, ρ(UO8), ν/ρ(UO8), δ/ρ(UO4), POM deformation mode, δ(W-O-W/W=O/U-O-W), ν(W-O-W), and ν(U-O-W)] were sensitive to changes in counterion composition and packing. To more effectively compare different counterions configuration we developed counterion effective ionic radius (eIR) as a new structural parameter and comparisons between structural distortion parameters and counterion eIR strongly suggest modulation by the secondary lattice elements can affect structural and vibrational manifolds within POM complexes. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was used to quantitatively evaluate correlations observed within this investigation, and PLS statistical models showed strong correlation between counterion eIR and both structural distortion parameters and vibrational mode frequencies. Overall, this investigation illustrates how to diversify the composition of lattice elements within UW10 complexes and confirms the integral role counterions play in modulating the structural and vibrational characteristics of Lindqvist POM complexes with f-elements.
