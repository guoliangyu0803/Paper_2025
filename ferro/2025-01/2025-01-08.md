Abstract: The exact solution of ferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a transverse field, which can be used to describe the critical phenomena in low-dimensional quantum spin systems, is derived by equivalence between the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model with a transverse field and the ferromagnetic three-dimensional (3D) Ising model. The results obtained in this work can be extended to be suitable for the antiferromagnetic 2D Ising model with a transverse field in the cases without frustration.

Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.

arXiv:2501.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.

arXiv:2501.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CaMn$_2$P$_2$ exemplifies the realization of a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model of a corrugated honeycomb magnetic lattice. Previous studies show that below the N\'eel temperature ($T_{\rm N}$), the system forms a cycloidal $6\times 6$ $ab$-plane magnetic unit cell that conforms with various magnetic space groups. Here, we present single-crystal neutron-diffraction studies across expansive reciprocal-space volumes, confirming the cycloidal magnetic structure while uncovering further distinctive features. We find evidence for three magnetic domains, the analysis of which narrows the possible magnetic model structures. At $T_{\rm N}$, the insulator exhibits a sharp phase transition, above which the spin structure transforms into a spiral spin liquid state, evident via a continuous ring of scattering with degenerate wavevectors corresponding to a collection of short-range spiral spin configurations. These degenerate states emerge as thermal fluctuations effectively reduce the $J_3$ interaction. The integration of experimental, theoretical, and real-space simulation results reveals the intricate balance of exchange interactions ($J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$) that stabilizes the ground-state magnetic structure and drives the emergence of a sought-after $U$(1)-symmetric spiral spin-liquid state with easy-plane anisotropy above the transition temperature.

arXiv:2501.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRh2As2 is a newly discovered candidate of multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor (Tc=0.3 K) with intriguing physical properties. Here, we employ soft point-contact spectroscopy to investigate its energy gap behaviors in both the normal and superconducting states. The differential conductance below Tc reveals an estimated superconducting energy gap of 2{\Delta}SC=0.24 meV and thus an extremely strong superconducting pairing strength 2{\Delta}SC/kBTc=8.8, which is comparable to those of cuprates and iron-based high-Tc superconductors as well as infinite-layer nickelates. Above Tc, a well-defined pseudogap feature is manifested as a V-shaped dip in the differential conductance spanning an energy scale of 2{\Delta}g=0.95-3.0 meV. The pseudogap feature persists to the highest characteristic temperature of Tg=8-9 K and is gradually suppressed by magnetic field of Bg=9.0T regardless of its direction relative to the crystallographic axes. The observation of pseudogap features prior to the superconducting phase transition enriches the phase diagram of CeRh2As2 and provides a novel platform to study the interplay of unconventional superconductivity and pseudogap phenomena.

# Generalized Onsager's Relation in Magnon Hall Effect and Its Implication

arXiv:2501.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the isotropic exchange coupling is equally important as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) interaction in determining the magnon Hall effect, and it can transform to the latter under proper gauge transformation. Moreover, the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the magnon Hall effect without the DM interaction. Both features are exemplified in ferromagnetic honeycomb lattices. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.

arXiv:2501.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite several theoretical predictions regarding the physics and application of quantum wells (QWs) of topological crystalline insulators (TCI), no quantized charge transport via helical or chiral edge states has been experimentally demonstrated for such a class of systems. In this study, we report here on a successful growth by molecular beam epitaxy of high crystalline quality Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se:Bi/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs with $x = 0.25$ and $y = 0.1$, and on their magnetotransport characterization as a function of the QW thickness between 10 and 50 nm, temperatures down to 300 mK, perpendicular and tilted magnetic fields up to 36 T. The character of weak antilocalization magnetoresistance and universal conductance fluctuations points to a notably long phase coherence length. It is argued that a relatively large magnitude of the dielectric constant of IV-VI compounds suppresses the decoherence by electron-electron scattering. The observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations and the quantum Hall effect, together with multiband $k\cdot p$ modelling, have enabled us to assess valley degeneracies, the magnitude of strain, subbands effective masses, the Berry phases, and the topological phase diagram as a function of the QW thickness. Our results demonstrate that further progress in controlling Sn content, carrier densities, and magnetism in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs will allow for the exploration of the topologically protected quantized edge transport even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, a reduced strength of electron-electron interactions will result in the absence of unpaired localized spins in the topological gap and, thus, in a substantially longer topological protection length compared to the quantum spin Hall materials explored so far.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.

Abstract: Since the discovery of high-entropy superconductors in 2014, superconductivity has remained a focal point of interest in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs). Here, we report a series of (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors crystallized in the BCC structure, whose superconductivity was characterized by resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The study found that the (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEAs exhibit bulk superconductivity. With the doping of Nb, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases from 5.31 K to 9.11 K, and the normalized Cel jumps at Tc, and the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency exhibit dome-shaped curves. Results from specific heat measurements indicate that the superconductivity is of a strongly coupled s-wave type observed. Furthermore, at low Nb content, the upper critical field of the samples is larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The strongly coupling behavior and large upper critical field in s-wave type (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors are unusual, as they typically occur in other unconventional superconductors. Thus, (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx may have significant potential in the research and understanding of physical mechanisms.

Abstract: Although multiferroics have undergone extensive examination for several decades, the occurrence of ferroelectricity induced by orbital order is only scarcely documented. In this study, we propose the existence of spontaneous ferroelectric states featuring a finite out-of-plane polarization in monolayer compounds of magnetic transition metal di-halides. Our first principles analysis reveals that partially occupied d-orbital states within octahedra exhibit a preference for spatial orbital order within a two-dimensional lattice. The absence of inversion symmetry, arising from orbital order, serves as the driving force introducing additional electric polarization along the out-of-plane direction. Unlike previous reported orbital orders arising from metal states in lattice, the non-colinear ones we studied in this work relate to the transition between two insulator states. The resultant asymmetric Jahn-Teller distortions are accompanied as the consequence producing additional ionic polarization. Importantly, our findings indicate that this mechanism is not confined to a specific material but is a shared characteristic among a series of monolayer transition metal magnetic di-halides, proposing an innovative form of intrinsic two-dimensional multiferroic physics.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.

# Universal classes of disorder scatterings in in-plane anomalous Hall effect

Abstract: The in-plane anomalous Hall effect (IPAHE) with planar Hall current and magnetization/magnetic fields in various quantum materials has received increasing attentions. Most of current efforts are devoted to the intrinsic part due to the Berry curvature of electronic bands, however, how the disorder scatterings affect the extrinsic part (skew scattering and side jump) still remains largely elusive. Here we theoretically investigated the three universal classes of disorder scatterings (scalar, spin-conserving and spin-flipping) on the IPAHE based on the prototypical two-dimensional massive Dirac fermion model with warping term under generic Zeeman fields. We find the different disorder scatterings result in distinct dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity on disorder strength and recover previous known results in some limits. Remarkably, the spin-flipping scattering could give rise to nontrivial contributions featuring sinusoidal oscillation with periods of $\pi$ and $2\pi$ to the extrinsic part, in contrast to the standard two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. Our work unveils the rich features of anomalous transport in planar Hall geometry in the presence of disorder scatterings and provides some useful insights into the magnetotransport phenomena.

Abstract: This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.

# Intrinsic thermal Hall effect of optical phonons enhanced by discrete rotational symmetry

**Authors:** Xuesong Hu, Junren Shi

arXiv:2501.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity contributed by optical phonons in a cubic system. The discrete rotational symmetry of the system splits the degeneracy of transverse modes across most regions of wave-vector space, except along a few high-symmetry lines. Consequently, in the presence of an external magnetic field, phonon Berry curvatures become sharply peaked near the high-symmetry lines. We find that the singular distribution of the Berry curvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly enhanced compared to an isotropic system. It exhibits a nonlinear $B\ln B$ dependence on the magnetic field $B$ and a non-monotonic temperature dependence. At elevated temperatures, it reverses sign and approaches a non-vanishing value asymptotically. Our analysis indicates that the behavior results from competition between contributions from Berry curvatures near different high-symmetry lines.

Abstract: The study of the Heisenberg-Kitaev honeycomb ferromagnets has recently drawn attention because of their rich topological properties. Topological phase transitions may arise when there exist two or more distinct topological phases, and they are often revealed by a gap-closing phenomenon. In this work, we investigate the magnonic properties of honeycomb ferromagnets exhibiting Kitaev and DMI interactions in the presence of a Heisenberg exchange and magnetocrystalline anisotropy exposed to a magnetic field. We employ the Self-Consistent Renormalization (SCR) spin wave theory to investigate the effects of magnon-magnon interactions (MMIs) and thermal fluctuations on the properties of magnons. Our findings demonstrate that the magnon system undergoes topological phase transitions driven by temperature and magnetic fields, which are attributed to MMIs. Specifically, as the temperature rises, the magnon band gap at the Dirac points closes and reopens at the critical temperature Tc , which is below the Curie temperature. By showing that the Chern numbers of the magnonic bands are distinct above and below Tc , we confirm that the gap-closing phenomenon is indeed a signature for the topological phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the thermal Hall conductivity in the magnonic system exhibits a sign reversal at Tc , which can serve as an experimental probe of its topological nature.

Abstract: Combining first-principles calculations and tight-binding Hamiltonians, we study the stack-dependent behaviour of electronic and topological properties of layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Lateral shift of top septuple-layer greatly modify electronic properties, and even induce topological phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with $C=1$ and trivial magnetic insulators with $C=0$. The local energy minimum of ``incorrect" stacking order exhibits thickness-dependent topology opposite to the usual stacking order, which is attribute to relatively weakened interlayer Te-Te interaction in ``incorrect" stacking configuration. Our effective model analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved, and we also propose two optical setups that can effectively differentiate between different stacking configurations. Our findings underscores the nuanced and profound influence that interlayer sliding in magnetic topological materials can have on the macroscopic quantum states, opening new avenues for the design and engineering of topological quantum materials.

Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of a magnetic kagome metal EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4}, which undergoes magnetic ordering below $T_\mathrm{C}=10.5$ K. Unlike typical magnets showing anomalous magnetotransport in their ordered states, EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} exhibits unusual magnetotransport behaviors in its paramagnetic phase. Specifically, the magnetoconductivity shows a linear dependence on magnetic field at low fields below $\sim 1$ T, and the Hall conductivity undergoes a sign change below about 2 T. These behaviors resemble those observed in the charge density wave (CDW) phase of kagome metals \textit{A}V\textsubscript{3}Sb\textsubscript{5} (\textit{A} = K, Rb, Cs). The anomalous magnetotransport in \textit{A}V\textsubscript{3}Sb\textsubscript{5} has commonly been attributed to the possible emergence of a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral CDW order. However, given the absence of CDW in EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} and its manifestation exclusively in the paramagnetic state, the anomalous magnetotransport observed in EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} is likely associated with multiband transport and/or the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.

Abstract: Chirality, an intrinsic preference for a specific handedness, is a fundamental characteristic observed in nature. In magnetism, magnetic chirality arises from the anti-symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in competition with the symmetric Heisenberg exchange interaction. Traditionally, the anti-symmetric interaction has been considered minor relative to the symmetric interaction. In this study, we demonstrate an observation of giant magnetic chirality during the dimensionality crossover of magnetic materials from three-dimensional to two-dimensional. The ratio between the anti-symmetric and symmetric interactions exhibits a reversal in their dominance over this crossover, overturning the traditional consideration. This observation is validated theoretically using a non-local interaction model and tight-binding calculation with distinct pairing schemes for each exchange interaction throughout the crossover. Additional experiments investigating the asphericity of orbital moments corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in shaping magnetic chirality and offer strategies for engineering chiral magnet states with unprecedented strength, desired for the design of spintronic materials.

Abstract: Perovskite BaSnO3 has an Sn s-orbital conduction band minimum, which makes it of interest as a transparent-conducting oxide parent compound but also contraindicates the ferroelectric instability characteristic of the related compound BaTiO3. In this work, we studied the effect of (001) compressive strain on BaSnO3 using first-principles methods. We found that, with low compressive strain, symmetry breaking takes cubic BaSnO3 to a nonpolar tetragonal state, with a first-order phase transition to a hidden highly-polarized ferroelectric supertetragonal state at about -5%. Based on the facts that the mismatch of lattice constant in experiment between BaSnO3 and SrTiO3 is about -5.2% and coherent growth of BaSnO3 on SrTiO3 has been experimentally realized for BaSnO3 layers thinner than 3 unit-cells, we studied a series of SrTiO3/BaSnO3 superlattices with one or two unit-cells of BaSnO3 and several unit-cells of SrTiO3. We found that the superlattices are ferroelectric with large polarizations. We propose that the origin of ferroelectricity in the superlattices is the mechanical and electrical coupling of the BaSnO3 and SrTiO3 layers, with polarized supertetragonal state of BaSnO3 induced by compressive-strain from the SrTiO3 layers and polarization of the SrTiO3 layers by the polar BaSnO3 layers. Due to the distinctive electronic states in the BaSnO3 layers, the realization of ferroelectricity holds promise for the design of novel electronic devices.

Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in magnetic topological insulators induces a Dirac gap in the topological surface state (TSS), leading to exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Yet, the interplay between TRSB and topology in superconductors remains underexplored due to limited suitable materials. Here we employ zero-field muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) as a sensitive probe of TRSB to map out the electronic phase diagrams of iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. For the Te composition $x=0.64$ with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=14.5$ K, which is known to host a TSS and Majorana zero modes within vortices, we detect spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$ distinct from a magnetic order. This signifies a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk, revealing the convergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with topologically nontrivial electronic structures in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. Given the relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ and the tunability of the Fermi level through chemical substitution, iron-chalcogenide superconductors offer an intriguing platform for investigating the synergy between topological superconductivity and TRSB.

Abstract: Composites of ferroelectric and paraelectric perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their application potential in energy storage as well as novel computing and memory devices. So far the main focus of research has been on superlattices and ferroelectric particles in a paraelectric matrix, while the impact of paraelectric inclusions on the ferroelectric matrix is surprisingly underrepresented. To close this gap in knowledge we perform molecular dynamics simulations using an $ab\ initio$ derived effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$--SrTiO$_3$ and reveal the dependency of phase stability and phase transitions on the size of paraelectric inclusions. We discuss how the combination of compressive strain and depolarization fields at the SrTiO$_3$ interfaces induces large local polarization, complex domain structures and coexisting phases as well as diffuse phase transitions and reduced coercive fields.

Abstract: Spin-splitting antiferromagnets with spin-polarized band structures in momentum space have garnered intensive research attention due to their zero net magnetic moments, ultras fast spin dynamics as conventional antiferromagnets, and spin-polarized transport properties akin to ferromagnets, making them promising candidates for antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, unlike spin-torque switching of ferromagnets by electric current, efficient electric control of spin-splitting antiferromagnetic order remains challenges. In this work, we identify prototypes of multiferroic spin-splitting antiferromagnets, including BiFeO3, Fe2Mo3O8 and compensated ferrimagnet GaFeO3 with ferroelectric polarization as well as spin-polarized electronic structures. We establish design principles for the spin-splitting multiferroic antiferromagnets and compensated ferrimagnets, elucidating the band symmetry features in Brillouin zone. We demonstrate that the spin polarization in spin-splitting magnets, despite of zero net magnetic moment, can be switched by ferroelectric polarization, providing an efficient means of controlling the antiferromagnetic order. Our work may inspire future development of novel multiferroic functional magnets with zero magnetic moments and pave the way for their applications in magnetoelectric spintronic devices.

Abstract: We present a formalism based on colour symmetry to analyse the momentum-space spin textures of non-collinear magnets. We show that, out of the spin textures allowed by the magnetic point group, one can extract an `altermagnetic' component that is invariant by general rotations in spin space, and can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this approach in the case of three complex, non-collinear magnets, Mn$_3$Ir(Ge,Si), Pb$_2$MnO$_4$ and Mn$_3$GaN. For Mn$_3$GaN, we also show that the predictions of colour-symmetry analysis are consistent with density functional theory calculations performed on the same system both with and without spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.

Abstract: Control of individual spins at the atomic level holds great promise for miniaturized spintronics, quantum sensing, and quantum information processing. Both single atomic and molecular spin centers are prime candidates for these applications and are often individually addressed and manipulated using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In this work, we present a hybrid approach and demonstrate a robust method for self-assembly of magnetic organometallic complexes consisting of individual iron (Fe) atoms and molecules on a silver substrate using STM. We employ two types of molecules, bis(dibenzoylmethane) copper(II) [Cu(dbm)2] and iron phthalocyanine (FePc). We show that in both cases the Fe atoms preferentially attach underneath the benzene ring ligand of the molecules, effectively forming an organometallic half-sandwich arene complex, Fe(C6H6), that is akin to the properties of metallocenes. In both situations, a molecule can be combined with up to two Fe atoms. In addition, we observe a change in the magnetic properties of the attached Fe atoms in scanning tunneling spectroscopy, revealing a distinct Kondo signature at the Fe sites. We explain the latter using density functional theory calculations, and find that the bond formation between the Fe 3d-orbitals and the benzene {\pi}-molecular orbitals creates a favorable situation for Kondo screening of the d_xz- and d_yz-like orbitals. Thus, this work establishes a reliable design principle for forming hybrid organometallic complexes and simultaneous tuning of their atomic spin states.

Abstract: We develop a general formalism of phonon magnetic moment by including the relaxation process. We then identify the skew-scattering and side-jump contributions to the phonon magnetic moment originating from the non-adiabaticity, both of which are related to the nonlocal phonon Berry curvature and are in close analogy to those in the electronic Hall effect. All contributions of the phonon magnetic moment are exemplified in a honeycomb lattice, showing that the extrinsic contribution can be as important as the intrinsic one and that the resulting phonon angular momentum varies significantly across the Brillouin zone. Our work offers a systematic framework of the phonon chirality and paves the way of tuning the phonon magnetic moment through the non-adiabaticity.

Abstract: The demand for efficient data processing motivates a shift toward in-memory computing architectures. Ferroelectric materials, particularly AlScN, show great promise for next-generation memory devices. However, their widespread application is limited due challenges such as high coercive fields, leakage currents and limited stability. Our work introduces a novel synthesis approach for ferroelectric AlScN thin films using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Through a combinatorial study, we investigate the effect of scandium content and substrate bias on the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films deposited using metal-ion synchronized (MIS) HiPIMS. Leveraging the high ionization rates of HiPIMS and optimally timed substrate bias potentials, we enhance the adatom mobility at low temperatures. Our films exhibit a high degree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as low as 250{\deg}C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields comparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced remanent polarization (158-172.0 {\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent polarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further evaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory applications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible technique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the way for their application in non-volatile memory applications.

Abstract: Spin Hall effect (SHE) in two-dimensional (2D) materials is promising to effectively manipulate spin angular momentum and identify topological properties. In this work, we implemented an automated Wannierization with spin-orbit coupling on 426 non-magnetic monolayers including 210 metal and 216 insulators. Intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) has been calculated to find candidates exhibiting novel properties. We discover that Y$_2$C$_2$I$_2$ has an unconventional SHE with canted spin due to low crystal symmetry, Ta$_4$Se$_2$ is a metallic monolayer with exceptionally high SHC, and the semi-metal Y$_2$Br$_2$ possesses efficient charge-to-spin conversion induced by anti-crossing in bands. Moreover, quantum spin Hall insulators are investigated for quantized SHC. The present work provides a high-quality Wannier Hamiltonian database of 2D materials, and paves the way for the integration of 2D materials into high-performance and low-power-consumption spintronic devices.

Abstract: It has been indicated that the path forward for the widespread usage of ferroelectric (FE) materials may be considerably facilitated through the reduction of programming voltages to on-chip logic compatible values of < 1 V. Obstacles involve issues related to the scaling of the FEs to lower thickness as well as the presence of an interfacial layer (IL) between the high permittivity FE and the substrate -- resulting in wasted voltage across the IL. Here, we show how lower operating voltages along with a higher tunneling electroresistance (TER) could be achieved through IL engineering. We use piezoresponse force microscopy and fabricated ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) to show that ultra-thin FE films deposited on single layer graphene can exhibit polarization switching at ~ 0.8 V with significant TER.

Abstract: We study the inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity. The vacuum configuration of the symmetry-broken phase is not simply the constant Higgs vacuum but is a nontrivial function of spatial coordinates, satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equations. The vacuum of zero winding number has zero magnetic flux but its non-zero magnetic field depends on spatial coordinates. The corresponding vacuum energy is negative for weak coupling $(\lambda < 1)$, zero for critical BPS coupling $(\lambda = 1)$, and positive for strong coupling $(\lambda > 1)$ by an over-, exact-, and under-cancellation of the huge positive impurity energy. This distinct vacuum energies are consistent with classification of the type I and I$\!$I superconductivity in dirty conventional superconductors. Non-BPS vortex configurations are also obtained in the presence of inhomogeneity. Their rest energies favor energetically vortex-impurity composite in conventional type I$\!$I superconductivity, consistent with imperfect diamagnetism. The delta function limit of Gaussian type impurity suggests the formation of vortex-lattice composite which elucidates flux-pinning in the context of inhomogeneous field theory.

Abstract: Reorienting polyatomic ions such as NH4+ and NO3- exhibit weak magnetic fields because the ions at the extremities trace out current loops; if the periodic reorientations become long-range ordered (i.e. gearing of neighboring NO3-), then the magnetic susceptibility should exhibit a unique signature along the different crystallographic axes. For the case of ammonium nitrate NH4NO3, we report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic susceptibility along the a- and b-axes upon crossing its order-disorder phase transition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest the first step pertains to the NO3- planes shifting away from facing only along the b-axis and onto the a-axis by 45{\deg}. The second step is attributed to the disordering (ungearing) of the NH4+ and NO3-. In contrast, only one step was observed in the magnetic susceptibility along the c-axis and its large magnitude suggest the NO3- remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find evidence that the NH4+ become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c-axis only until phase V. The approach employed in this work can be extended to experimentally study the lattice dynamics of other solids possessing planar ions such as amphidynamic crystals.

Abstract: We study Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large "thermal" subspace and the small "non-thermal" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS, which demonstrates that QMBS survive under large classes of local perturbations. We illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic $\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS.Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to recover results of previous "brute-force" numerical searches for such Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we discuss its implications to dynamics.

Abstract: Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators offers an ideal platform to explore exotic topological phenomena, such as axion electrodynamics, quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and Majorana edge modes. However, these emerging new physical effects have rarely been experimentally observed due to the limited choice of suitable materials. Here, we predict the van der Waals layered V$_2$WS$_4$ and its related materials show intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We find extremely rich magnetic topological states in V$_2$WS$_4$, including an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, the axion state with the long-sought quantized topological magnetoelectric effect, three-dimensional QAH state, as well as a collection of QAH insulators and intrinsic axion insulators in odd- and even-layer films, respectively. Remarkably, the N\'eel temperature of V$_2$WS$_4$ is predicted to be much higher than that of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the topological quantum physics research and application.

Abstract: Measurements of the Fermi surface are a fundamental technique for determining the electrical and magnetic properties of solids. In 2D systems, the area and diameter of the Fermi surface is typically measured using Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and commensurability oscillations respectively. However, these techniques are unable to detect changes in the parity of the Fermi surface (i.e. when +k $\neq$ -k). Here, we show that transverse magnetic focussing can be used to detect such changes, because focussing only measures a well defined section of the Fermi surface and does not average over +k and -k. Furthermore, our results show that focussing is an order of magnitude more sensitive to changes in the Fermi surface than other 2D techniques, and could be used to investigate similar Fermi surface changes in other 2D systems.

Abstract: We uncover a new superconducting state with partial spin polarization induced by a magnetic field. This state, which we call "magnonic superconductor", lacks a conventional pairing order parameter, but is characterized instead by a composite order parameter that represents the binding of electron pairs and magnons. We rigorously demonstrate the existence of magnonic superconductivity with high transition temperature in one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models with repulsive interaction. We further show that magnonic Cooper pairs can attract to form higher-charge bound states, which can give rise to charge-$6e$ superconductivity.

Abstract: Binary compound FeGe hosts multiple structures, from cubic and hexagonal to monoclinic. Compared to the well-known skyrmion lattice in the cubic phase and the antiferromagnetic charge-density wave in the hexagonal phase, the monoclinic FeGe is less explored. Here, we synthesized the monoclinic FeGe films on Al2O3 (001) and studied their structural, magnetic, and transport properties. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicate that the FeGe films are epitaxial to the substrate. Unlike the antiferromagnetic bulk, the monoclinic FeGe films are ferromagnetic with Curie-temperature as high as ~ 800 K, contributing to the anomalous Hall effect in the transport measurements. Similar to the hexagonal FeGe, we captured a structural phase transition in the monoclinic FeGe films at ~ 100 K in real and reciprocal spaces by transmission electron microscope. Our work enriches the phase diagram of the FeGe family and suggests that FeGe offers an ideal platform for studying multiphase transitions and related device applications.

Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical study of Pt3Sn2S2 a layered kagome type material inspired by recent investigation of Co3Sn2S2 reported in [Nature Communication 11, 3985 (2020) whose physical properties remain largely unexplored. Thermodynamic stability was confirmed via formation energy calculations while mechanical stability was evaluated using Voigt Reuss Hill approximation and elastic stability condition. Dynamical and thermal stability were validated through Phonon dispersion and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics simulations with Pughs criterion classifying the material as ductile. Spin orbit coupling induced band splitting, giving rise to Weyl points and a Weyl semimetal phase accompanied by a SOC driven transition from non relativistic band touching to relativistic band touching making a topological phase shift. Under applied pressure, the coupling of spin and valley degrees of freedom generates spin valley intertwined Dirac cones enabling tunable electronic properties for spintronic and valleytronic applications. Boltzman transport calculations using AMSET reveal a high Seebeck coefficient with SOC and low thermal conductivity highlighting its potential for high performance thermoelectric devices.

Abstract: We propose an approach to use linearly polarized light to imprint superconducting vortices. Within the framework of the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations we demonstrate the induction of the coherent vortex pairs that are moving in phase with electormagnetic wave oscillations. The overall vorticity of the superconductor remain zero throughout the cycle. Our results uncover rich multiscale dynamics of SC vorticity and suggest new optical applications for various types of structured light. In departure from classical laser printing, the laser printing proposed here can be viewed as quantum print where we induce quantum excitations in the SC liquid.

Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of ferroelectric domain-wall polarons in a minimal two-dimensional lattice model of electrons interacting with rotating dipoles. Along the domain-wall, the rotors polarize in opposite directions, causing the electron to localize along a particular lattice direction. The rotor-electron coupling is identified as the origin of a structural instability in the crystal that leads to the domain-wall formation via a symmetry-breaking process. Our results provide the first theoretical description of ferroelectric polarons, as discussed in the context of soft semiconductors.

Abstract: Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.

Abstract: We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional Kondo Lattice model, in which conduction electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to a Yao-Lee spin liquid. When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes. Our model describes a chiral topological superconductor with fractionalized charge-$e$ order parameter and spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, which may be of interest for certain heavy fermion superconductors, such as UTe$_2$.

Abstract: The motion of chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied in heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study specifically focuses on SOT-driven DWs in near Bloch-states, which we refer to as ``quasi-Bloch DWs". These quasi-Bloch DWs exhibit slower motion compared to Neel-type DWs, offering potential for achieving highly controllable DW positions. Here, we investigate the characteristics of SOT-driven motion of quasi-Bloch DWs in perpendicularly magnetized ultra-thin films consisting of W/CoFeB/MgO. For analyzing the DW motion, we employ a one-dimensional model incorporating parameters derived from experimental data obtained from our samples. Our model successfully reproduces the experimental results, which reveal variations in the direction and threshold current density of DW motion among different samples. Through theoretical analysis, we unveil that the DW remains in quasi-Bloch states during motion, with SOT serving as the primary driving force rather than spin transfer torque (STT). The direction of motion is determined not only by the sign combination of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and spin Hall angle but also by the strength of DMI, STT, and extrinsic DW pinning. Furthermore, we provide analytical expressions for the threshold current density required for SOT-driven quasi-Bloch DW motion. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of future DW devices with specific film structures.

Abstract: Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$) was reported [Liu~\emph{et al.}, Nature Materials \textbf{23}, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$). We find that V$_{Pd}$ (V$_{Te}$) is the most stable defect in the~\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex V$_{Pd+4Te}$ is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 $\mu_{B}$. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to V$_{Te}$ indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer.

Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.

Abstract: We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit nonrelativistic spin splitting due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and have been garnering significant attention as promising materials for spintronic applications. In contrast, conventional antiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking and have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional antiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about nontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and nonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting spin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the electronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our prediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate its multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity. Our findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets, providing another perspective for designing spintronic materials.

Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.

Abstract: Analytically solving the magnetostatic Maxwell equations in the bispherical coordinates, we calculate the magnetic field around two uniformly magnetized spheres oriented so that their magnetic moments are parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the spheres. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is often claimed in the literature, the magnetic interaction between such spheres is not equivalent to the interaction between two point magnetic dipoles placed in the centers of the spheres. The nonzero levitation force acting on a uniformly magnetized sphere or a point magnetic dipole above a superconducting sphere in the ideal Meissner state is a clear manifestation of the non-equivalence.

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a complex Hilbert Space with Hermitian operators for calculations in classical electromagnetism. This approach lets us derive a variety of fundamental expressions for electromagnetism using minimal mathematics and a calculation sequence well-known for traditional quantum mechanics. The purpose of this Hilbert Space is not to calculate the expectation values of known observables, however, like in Koopman-von Neumann-Sudarshan (KvNS) mechanics (for classical point particles) and quantum mechanics (quantum waves or fields). We also demonstrate the existence of the wave commutation relationship $[\hat{x},\hat{k}]=i$, which is the never seen before classical analogue to the canonical commutator $[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$. The difference between classical and quantum mechanics lies in the presence of $\hbar$. This is the first report of noncommutativity of observables for a classical theory. Further comparisons between electromagnetism, KvNS classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics are made. Finally, supplementing the analysis presented, we additionally demonstrate for the first time a completely relativistic version of Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations \citep{Dyson}. Unlike what \citet{Dyson} indicated, there is no need for Galilean relativity for the proof to work. This fits parsimoniously with our usage of classical commutators for electromagnetism.

Abstract: The role of magnetic moments in electrodynamics is examined in this work. The effects are described in the context of conventional quantum electrodynamics expressed in terms of the electromagnetic fields or in the context of an extended Poynting theorem and extended Maxwell equations. These extensions take into account the energetics of interaction of magnetic moments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We show how magnetic moment effects are included in either version of electrodynamics and that these apparently different formulations can give consistent results. In either case, we express the interactions in terms of electromagnetic fields only, avoiding use of a vector potential.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as quantum sensors capable of detecting nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals at unprecedented length scales, ranging from picoliter sample volumes down to single spins at the diamond surface. While high-resolution (few hertz) NV-NMR spectroscopy has been demonstrated at the micrometer scale, it has remained elusive at the nanometer scale. In this regime, only the detection of statistical polarization has been achieved, limiting spectral resolution due to molecular diffusion in liquid samples. Here, we demonstrate that detecting coherent signals from a uniformly polarized nanoscale sample, where polarization is enhanced beyond thermal levels, successfully overcomes this limitation, enabling single-digit hertz spectral resolution and the capacity to resolve scalar couplings. These results pave the way for high-resolution nanoscale NMR spectroscopy at interfaces, surfaces, and potentially even single molecules.

Abstract: The demand for efficient data processing motivates a shift toward in-memory computing architectures. Ferroelectric materials, particularly AlScN, show great promise for next-generation memory devices. However, their widespread application is limited due challenges such as high coercive fields, leakage currents and limited stability. Our work introduces a novel synthesis approach for ferroelectric AlScN thin films using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Through a combinatorial study, we investigate the effect of scandium content and substrate bias on the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films deposited using metal-ion synchronized (MIS) HiPIMS. Leveraging the high ionization rates of HiPIMS and optimally timed substrate bias potentials, we enhance the adatom mobility at low temperatures. Our films exhibit a high degree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as low as 250{\deg}C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields comparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced remanent polarization (158-172.0 {\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent polarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further evaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory applications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible technique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the way for their application in non-volatile memory applications.

Abstract: Spin Hall effect (SHE) in two-dimensional (2D) materials is promising to effectively manipulate spin angular momentum and identify topological properties. In this work, we implemented an automated Wannierization with spin-orbit coupling on 426 non-magnetic monolayers including 210 metal and 216 insulators. Intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) has been calculated to find candidates exhibiting novel properties. We discover that Y$_2$C$_2$I$_2$ has an unconventional SHE with canted spin due to low crystal symmetry, Ta$_4$Se$_2$ is a metallic monolayer with exceptionally high SHC, and the semi-metal Y$_2$Br$_2$ possesses efficient charge-to-spin conversion induced by anti-crossing in bands. Moreover, quantum spin Hall insulators are investigated for quantized SHC. The present work provides a high-quality Wannier Hamiltonian database of 2D materials, and paves the way for the integration of 2D materials into high-performance and low-power-consumption spintronic devices.

In our system, a transverse disorder in the second-order nonlinear coupling of a nonlinear photonic crystal causes the idler-signal light beam, representing the pseudospin current, to become localized in the transverse plane. This effect depends strongly on the nonlinear coupling strength, controlled by the optical pump power, revealing its inherently nonlinear and non-perturbative nature. Furthermore, this phenomenon is marked by decaying Rabi oscillations between the idler and signal fields, linked to the disorder properties, suggesting an accompanied longitudinal decoherence effect. Our findings offer deep insights into spin transport in disordered magnetic textures and open avenues for exploring complex magnetic phases and phase transitions using nonlinear optics.

Abstract: Following the successful completion and testing of the sCCU-type undulator with 28mm period, we have designed, prototyped, constructed and bench tested another sCCU-type undulator with a much shorter 19mm-period magnetic structure. sCCU-type undulators are compact variable-gap devices with hydraulic-assist driver and innovative hybrid magnetic structure. The hydraulic system provides compensation of magnetic forces and ensures compactness of the design. Owing to innovative magnetic structure, these undulators demonstrate magnetic peak field ~15% stronger compared to conventional hybrid-structure PM undulators. The newly constructed undulator is 1.5 m long, 0.38m high, 0.21 m wide and weighs ~ 180 kg. Magnetic structure has 19 mm period and 6.5 mm minimum gap. The gap can be varied from 6.5mm to 80mm. At minimum (6.5mm) gap, the undulator demonstrated 0.87 T peak magnetic field. Magnetic field measurements indicated satisfactory uniformity of the field and acceptable field integrals through the entire gap range. High reliability of undulator mechanics and the control system was confirmed by extensive, varied and prolonged testing.

Abstract: It has been indicated that the path forward for the widespread usage of ferroelectric (FE) materials may be considerably facilitated through the reduction of programming voltages to on-chip logic compatible values of < 1 V. Obstacles involve issues related to the scaling of the FEs to lower thickness as well as the presence of an interfacial layer (IL) between the high permittivity FE and the substrate -- resulting in wasted voltage across the IL. Here, we show how lower operating voltages along with a higher tunneling electroresistance (TER) could be achieved through IL engineering. We use piezoresponse force microscopy and fabricated ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) to show that ultra-thin FE films deposited on single layer graphene can exhibit polarization switching at ~ 0.8 V with significant TER.

Abstract: Instead of computing magneticallly induced (MI) current densities (CD) via the wave function and their quatum mechanical definition one can also use the differential form of the Ampere-Maxwell law to obtain them from spatial derivatives of the induced magnetic field. In magnetic molecular response calculations, the latter can be done by by numerical derivativation of the so called ``nucleus-independent chemical shifts'' (NICS) which are avaialable to many standard quantum chemical programs. The resulting numerical MICD data is in contrast to many numerical MICDs computed via the wave function route, virtually divergence-free.

Abstract: At the J-PARC Muon Science Facility (MUSE), the MuSEUM collaboration is now performing new precision measurements of the ground state hyperfine structure (HFS) of both muonium and muonic helium atoms. High-precision measurements of the muonium ground-state HFS are recognized as one of the most sensitive tools for testing bound-state quantum electrodynamics theory to precisely probe the standard model and determine fundamental constants of the positive muon magnetic moment and mass. The same technique can also be employed to measure muonic helium HFS, obtain the negative muon magnetic moment and mass, and test and improve the theory of the three-body atomic system. Measurements at zero magnetic field have already yielded more accurate results than previous experiments for both muonium and muonic helium atoms. High-field measurements are now ready to start collecting data using the world's most intense pulsed muon beam at the MUSE H-line. We aim to improve the precision of previous measurements ten times for muonium and a hundred times or more for muonic helium. We review all the key developments for these new measurements, focusing on the high-field experiment, and report the latest results and prospects.

Abstract: Exerting forces on biomolecules inside living cells would allow us to probe their dynamic interactions in their native environment. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles represent a unique tool capable of pulling on biomolecules with the application of an external magnetic field gradient; however, their use has been restricted to biomolecules accessible from the extracellular medium. Targeting intracellular biomolecules represents an additional challenge due to potential nonspecific interactions with cytoplasmic or nuclear components. We present the synthesis of sulfobetaine-phosphonate block copolymer ligands, which provide magnetic nanoparticles which are stealthy and targetable in living cells. We demonstrate for the first time their efficient targeting in the nucleus and their use for magnetic micromanipulation of a specific genomic locus in living cells. We believe that these stable and furtive magnetic nanoprobes represent a promising tool to manipulate specific biomolecules in living cells and probe the mechanical properties of living matter at the molecular scale.

arXiv:2501.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reorienting polyatomic ions such as NH4+ and NO3- exhibit weak magnetic fields because the ions at the extremities trace out current loops; if the periodic reorientations become long-range ordered (i.e. gearing of neighboring NO3-), then the magnetic susceptibility should exhibit a unique signature along the different crystallographic axes. For the case of ammonium nitrate NH4NO3, we report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic susceptibility along the a- and b-axes upon crossing its order-disorder phase transition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest the first step pertains to the NO3- planes shifting away from facing only along the b-axis and onto the a-axis by 45{\deg}. The second step is attributed to the disordering (ungearing) of the NH4+ and NO3-. In contrast, only one step was observed in the magnetic susceptibility along the c-axis and its large magnitude suggest the NO3- remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find evidence that the NH4+ become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c-axis only until phase V. The approach employed in this work can be extended to experimentally study the lattice dynamics of other solids possessing planar ions such as amphidynamic crystals.

Abstract: Global gyrokinetic simulation of the ion temperature gradient mode shows that the radial electric field ($E_r$) well upshifts the critical temperature gradient near the magnetic axis, in the weak but not in the strong magnetic shear configuration. The geometric curvature effect significantly influences the $E \times B$ shear and the wave number near the axis, so that the $E_r$ well suppresses the high-n modes but has little effect on the low-n modes, which are suppressed by the weak magnetic shear effect. This new finding unravels the formation mechanism of the internal transport barrier in the weak central magnetic shear discharges.

We perform this investigation to determine the role the Displacement Current has in influencing longitudinal interactions attributed to particles of light as part of the long-standing problem of physical optics known as the wave-particle duality, in addition to exploration of the theories of faster than light propagation in theoretical longitudinal modes of electric transmission attributed to the Displacement Current.

During geospace storms, then, turbulent structuring as well as fast electrodynamics in the dayside polar ionosphere can be driven by wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere.

Abstract: A compact Halbach array magnet is used to measure the momentum of the secondary particles in EMPHATIC (Experiment to Measure the Production of Hadrons At a Test beam In Chicagoland). Hall probe data was taken for the central cylindrical bore of the magnet and a field map was constructed. COMSOL Multiphysics Software is used for modeling the magnet and constructing the corresponding magnetic field map. We present a fitting approach where the hall probe data is used to determine a 1mm-spacing map of the entire volume of the magnet using COMSOL. The new map will allow for linear interpolation within the volume, and expand the map to outside the measurement volume, thus increasing the acceptance and precision of EMPHATIC tracking system.

Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.

# Analyses of features of magnetic cycles at different amounts of dynamo supercriticality: Solar dynamo is about two times critical

Abstract: The growth of a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun and stars is usually possible when the dynamo number (D) is above a critical value Dc. As the star ages, its rotation rate and thus D decrease. Hence, the question is how far the solar dynamo is from the critical dynamo transition. To answer this question, we have performed a set of simulations using Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models at different values of dynamo supercriticality and analyzed various features of magnetic cycle. By comparing the recovery rates of the dynamo from the Maunder minimum and statistics (numbers and durations) of the grand minima and maxima with that of observations and we show that the solar dynamo is only about two times critical and thus not highly supercritical. The observed correlation between the polar field proxy and the following cycle amplitudes and Gnevyshev-Ohl rule are also compatible with this conclusion.

Abstract: We investigate how the strength of the Lorentz force alters stellar convection zone dynamics in a suite of buoyancy-dominated, three-dimensional, spherical shell convective dynamo models. This is done by varying only the magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm$, the non-dimensional form of the fluid's electrical conductivity $\sigma$. Because the strength of the dynamo magnetic field and the Lorentz force scale with $Pm$, it is found that the fluid motions, the pattern of convective heat transfer, and the mode of dynamo generation all differ across the $0.25 \leq Pm \leq 10$ range investigated here. For example, we show that strong magnetohydrodynamic effects cause a fundamental change in the surface zonal flows: differential rotation switches from solar-like (prograde equatorial zonal flow) for larger electrical conductivities to an anti-solar differential rotation (retrograde equatorial zonal flow) at lower electrical conductivities. This study shows that the value of the bulk electrical conductivity is important not only for sustaining dynamo action, but can also drive first-order changes in the characteristics of the magnetic, velocity, and temperature fields. It is also associated with the relative strength of the Lorentz force in the system as measured by the local magnetic Rossby number, $Ro_\ell^M$, which we show is crucial in setting the characteristics of the large-scale convection regime that generates those dynamo fields.

Abstract: In this paper, we optimize photon blockade in a cavity magnomechanical system using feedback by introducing optimized values for the phase and magnetic field coupling strength at each drive frequency. It is shown that the computed values significantly reduce the photon second-order correlation function in the dynamic Schrodinger equation. The Radau method, an implicit Runge-Kutta method, has been employed, which provides more accurate results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a frequency detuning between the magnon and photon can result in deep values of photon blockade. Utilizing these optimized parameters outperforms scenarios that rely on constant, non-optimized values. This approach provides strong potential for applications in quantum sensing and quantum computation.

Abstract: Chirality, an intrinsic preference for a specific handedness, is a fundamental characteristic observed in nature. In magnetism, magnetic chirality arises from the anti-symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in competition with the symmetric Heisenberg exchange interaction. Traditionally, the anti-symmetric interaction has been considered minor relative to the symmetric interaction. In this study, we demonstrate an observation of giant magnetic chirality during the dimensionality crossover of magnetic materials from three-dimensional to two-dimensional. The ratio between the anti-symmetric and symmetric interactions exhibits a reversal in their dominance over this crossover, overturning the traditional consideration. This observation is validated theoretically using a non-local interaction model and tight-binding calculation with distinct pairing schemes for each exchange interaction throughout the crossover. Additional experiments investigating the asphericity of orbital moments corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in shaping magnetic chirality and offer strategies for engineering chiral magnet states with unprecedented strength, desired for the design of spintronic materials.

Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of topologically protected interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D problems, but the 2D case is qualitatively different, because the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples presented in the paper are consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as has also been shown to be the case in 1D and 1.5D.

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of how ion mobility affects electron density and temperature in hypersonic flows. We compare two ion mobility models: one derived from Gupta-Yos cross-sections, and the other from swarm drift velocity experiments. The ion mobility model significantly alters the plasma density around a hypersonic waverider, with increases of more than twofold observed at low dynamic pressures and high Mach numbers. This is partly due to electron loss through surface catalysis, which depends on ambipolar diffusion scaling with ion mobility. We also derive novel scaling laws that highlight the strong dependence of electron cooling on ion mobility both within the quasi-neutral regions and the non-neutral plasma sheaths. Electron cooling influences the electron temperature across the plasma, leading to a previously unrecognized impact of ion mobility on plasma bulk temperature. This in turn affects plasma density via electron-ion recombination rates which are temperature-dependent. Accurately modeling ion mobility is critical for predicting hypersonic plasma behavior, with important implications for optimizing magnetohydrodynamic technologies and mitigating or exploiting plasma-induced interference with electromagnetic waves.

Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has high spectral resolution and is a useful tool for studying atom dynamics. In this paper, we show a smallest unit of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) for 2DES, that is, a three-level system. It is found that the original main peak is split into four small ones due to the introduction of the EIT. It suggests that the homogeneous broadening of 2DES can be effectively reduced by the EIT. Moreover, in sharp contrast to a constant height, the height of the peaks will manifest a damped oscillation with respect to the population time. It seems that the quantum-beat phenomenon appears. These findings may help us obtain more information about the dynamics of excited states.

# Unveiling the Ferroelectric Competition and Transition Mechanisms in Hybrid Organic-inorganic Perovskite Heterojunction

## 揭示杂化有机-无机钙钛矿异质结中的铁电竞争和转变机制

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5713755/latest

The non-volatile spontaneous ferroelectric polarization (FE) field serves as a cornerstone for applying ferroelectric materials in electronic devices, yet it is frequently mitigated by charge trapping (CT) at defect sites. Achieving an effective transition between FE and CT is challenging due to the inherent opposition of the two mechanisms and the uncontrollable CT types in ferroelectric materials. Here, we realized polarity-dependent ferroelectric competition and transition in ferroelectric heterojunction transistors, by integrating a hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric (HOIPFs) layer embedded with electron trapping sites. Through theoretical calculations and experimental validation, we demonstrate competition and transition mechanisms between FE and CT based on the polarity of the semiconductor layer. The electron-majority n-type semiconductor exhibits CT behavior, while the electron-minority p-type semiconductors exhibit the FE mechanism. Leveraging the FE transition, our bipolar ferroelectric heterojunction transistors enable synergistic control of non-volatile FE and volatile CT modulation within a single device, significantly improving the recognition accuracy to 93.9% and a 3.7-fold boost in training efficiency.

The thermoelectric properties of hybrid system based on a single-level quantum dot coupled to a ferromagnetic metallic lead and attached to the surface states of a three-dimensional topological insulator are theoretically investigated. On the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, massless helical Dirac fermions emerge.We calculate the thermoelectric coefficients, including electrical conductance, Seebeck coefficient (thermopower), heat conductance, and the figure of merit, using the nonequilibrium Green&rsquo;s function technique. The results are analyzed in terms of the emergence of new effects. The calculations are performed within the Hubbard I approximation concerning the dot's Coulomb interactions. Additionally, the spin-dependent coupling of the quantum dot to the ferromagnetic lead lifts the spin degeneracy of the dot's level, which influences the transport properties of the system. We incorporate this effect perturbatively to obtain the spin-dependent renormalization of the dot's level.We also consider the case of finite spin accumulation in the ferromagnetic electrode, which leads to spin thermoelectric effects.

# Localization of Seizure Onset Zone based on Spatio-Temporal Independent Component Analysis on fMRI

## 基于fMRI时空独立成分分析的癫痫发作起发区定位

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5760498/latest

Localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) as a step of presurgical planning leads to higher efficiency in surgical and stimulation treatments. However, the clinical localization including structural, ictal, and invasive data acquisition and assessment is a difficult and long procedure with increasing challenges in patients with complex epileptic foci. The interictal methods are proposed to assist in presurgical planning with simpler data acquisition and higher speed. In this study, spatio-temporal component classification is presented for the localization of epileptic foci using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. This method is based on spatio-temporal independent component analysis (ST-ICA) on rs-fMRI with a component-sorting procedure upon dominant power frequency, biophysical constraints, spatial lateralization, local connectivity, temporal energy, and functional non-Gaussianity. This method aimed to utilize the rs-fMRI potential to reach a high spatial accuracy in localizing epileptic foci from interictal data while retaining the reliability of results for clinical usage. Thirteen patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent surgical resection and had seizure-free surgical outcomes after a 12-month follow-up were included in this study. All patients had pre-surgical structural MRI and rs-fMRI while post-surgical MRI images were available for ten. Based on the relationship between the localized foci and resection, the results were classified into three groups &amp;ldquo;fully concordant&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;partially concordant&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;discordant&amp;rdquo;. These groups had the resulting cluster aligned with, in the same lobe with, and outside the lobe of the resection area, respectively. This method showed promising results highlighting valuable features as SOZ functional biomarkers. Contrary to most methods which depend on simultaneous EEG information, the occurrence of epileptic spikes, and the depth of the epileptic foci, the presented method is entirely based on fMRI data making it independent from such information and considerably easier in terms of data acquisition, artifact removal, and implement.
