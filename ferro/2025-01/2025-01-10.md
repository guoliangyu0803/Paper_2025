# Capturing spin-torque effects with a semilocal exchange-correlation functional

## 用半位置交换相关函数捕获自旋扭矩效应

**Authors:** Marie-Therese Huebsch, Fabien Tran, Martijn Marsman

arXiv:2501.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We cure the lack of spin torque in semilocal exchange-correlation (XC) functionals by treating XC effects in the framework of spin-current-density-functional theory (SCDFT), and present the implementation of the first kind of this novel family of XC functionals in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP): An SCDFT functional featuring a U(1)$\times$SU(2) gauge-invariant $2\times 2$ XC potential. While the framework can be applied to other XC functionals, the presented flavor of the SCDFT functional is based on Becke-Roussel exchange and Colle-Salvetti correlation. In addition to the $2\times 2$ spin density and kinetic-energy density, the XC functional depends on the $2\times 2$ spin-current density. The implementation requires the computation of the spin-current density within the projector-augmented-wave method and the variation of the XC energy with respect to it. The application to a Cr$_3$ molecule and bulk MnO reveals (i) spin torque of the same order as obtained by methods including exact exchange, (ii) a counterintuitive contribution to the energy even in collinear ferromagnetic systems without spin-orbit coupling due to the gradient of the magnetization, and (iii) a similar computational cost per electronic step as calculations that depend on, inter alia, the kinetic-energy density, but convergence within fewer electronic steps.

Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.

arXiv:2501.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the presence of frustrated bond order in the form of short-range charge correlations in the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic compounds $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ ($Ln$ = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd). These compounds feature two-dimensional planes of trigonal-planar CdP$_3$ units that separate tetrahedral CdP$_4$ layers; collectively, these sandwich edge-sharing triangular lattice planes of $Ln$P$_6$ octahedra. Diffuse X-ray scattering data reveal an underlying bond instability within the unique CdP$_3$ units that breaks rotational symmetry along one Cd$-$P bond direction, with long-range ordering being frustrated via emergent kagome-ice bond correlations. Our results establish $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ as a rare class of materials where frustrated magnetism across a tunable rare-earth triangular network is embedded within a dopable semiconductor with a frustrated bond order instability.

# Tilted chiral spin textures in confined nanostructures with in-plane magnetic anisotropy

## 具有面内磁各向异性的受限纳米结构中的倾斜手性自旋织构

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04226

**Authors:** Wenlei Fu, Haiming Dong, Kai Chang

arXiv:2501.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nanoconfinement effects and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) can lead to tilted chiral spin textures in magnetic nanostructures, based on the analysis and simulation of theoretical models of micromagnetism. The tilted skyrmions are induced in confined nanoscale magnets with IMA under perpendicular magnetic fields. The chiral magnetic structures depend significantly on the size of the nanostructures. A controlled string of periodic skyrmion states emerges within the central magnetic domain wall, which can be tuned by the steady magnetic fields and the size of the nanostructures. Non-trivial topological states with non-integer topological charges are achieved by tuning the magnetic fields or the sizes of the nanostructures. Importantly, the periodic switching between the trivial and the non-trivial topological configurations is realized using an alternating magnetic field. Our study reveals an important mechanism for controlling novel skyrmion states via nanoconfinement effects and the IMA in magnetic nanostructures, and also provides a new approach for the development of magnetic field-modulated spin nanodevices.

**Authors:** Jihoon Keum, Kai-Xuan Zhang, Suik Cheon, Hyuncheol Kim, Jingyuan Cui, Giung Park, Yunyeong Chang, Miyoung Kim, Hyun-Woo Lee, Je-Geun Park

arXiv:2501.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetization switching by charge current without a magnetic field is essential for device applications and information technology. It generally requires a current-induced out-of-plane spin polarization beyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy-metal systems, where the current-induced spin polarization aligns in-plane orthogonal to the in-plane charge current and out-of-plane spin current. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for magnetic-field-free switching by fabricating a van-der-Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3 heterostructure. This new magnetic-field-free switching is possible because the current-driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interface precess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing an ultimate out-of-plane spin polarization. This interpretation is further confirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in-plane initialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. We successfully combined van-der-Waals magnet and oxide for the first time, especially taking advantage of spin-orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allows us to establish a new way of magnetic field-free switching. Our work demonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of large spin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and in doing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van-der-Waals magnets and oxide spintronics.

# High-Throughput Studies of Novel Magnetic Materials in Borides

**Authors:** Zhen Zhang, Kirill D. Belashchenko, Vladimir Antropov

arXiv:2501.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Borides are a versatile material family with various properties for valuable applications. Conventional magnetism, such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism in borides, have been extensively studied. However, research on unconventional magnetism in borides where quantum effects are dominant is scarce. Here, we implement a high-throughput workflow combining first-principles calculations, materials prediction, and magnetic properties calculations to discover novel magnetism and magnetic materials in borides. Successfully applying the workflow, we report three families of novel magnetic borides, including two families of borides exhibiting quantum magnetism. One is a family of dimerized quantum magnets among YCrB$_4$-type borides, which provides a rare platform for studying the spin-gap quantum critical point. The other is a family of altermagnets among FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type borides, extending the magnetic orderings exhibited by borides beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We also predict a family of magnetic laminate transition metal borides, known as the MAB phases, in the AlFe$_2$B$_2$-type family, which provide pure-phase or alloying candidates for studying magnetocaloric materials and the associated magnetic transitions. The workflow is expected to be used in further studies of novel magnetism and magnetic materials.

Abstract: The current progress in the description of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of rare-earth-based magnets is discussed. We show the typical values of critical parameters that define the physics of these materials for RECo$_5$ (RE = rare earth atom) using several currently popular electronic structure methods. The magnetic moments and magnetic anisotropy of 4\textit{f} atoms are obtained using several different approaches, including the total energy in constrained DFT and crystal field theory in DFT+HI methods. We also propose a Hund's rule constrained density functional method for the studies of the ground and excited states of magnets containing rare earth atoms. The method is applied to the RECo$_5$ family of magnets. The applicability and future extensions are discussed. The technique is suitable for high-throughput computational searches of new rare-earth-containing magnetic materials.

arXiv:2501.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report a custom design setup for the simultaneous measurement of magneto-resistance and MOKE imaging in longitudinal configuration for characterization of magnetic thin-films and sensors. The setup is designed so as to cope with a small signal to noise ratio of initial images and to allow sensitive magnetoresistance (MR) measurement at low field. An improved differential algorithm is used to get a good enough contrast of the magnetic images and get rid of beam illumination or small camera gain fluctuations. Home made power supply and pre-amplifier stage were designed so as to reduce the low frequency noise as well as the thermal electrical noise. A vector magnet is used to produce rotational magnetic field so as to study the magnetic anisotropy and calculate the anisotropic constants in magnetic thin films. Magnetoresistive sensors patterned on epitaxial La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin film have been characterized with this setup. The Images of the magnetization reversal process as well as the local magnetization loops deduced from these images provided evidence of a magnetic uniaxial anisotropy induced by the vicinal substrate. The magnetic anistropic constant of the films was then inferred from the MR measurements.

**Authors:** Tzu-chen Liu, Dale Gaines II, Hyungjun Kim, Adolfo Salgado-Casanova, Steven B. Torrisi, Chris Wolverton

arXiv:2501.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of the properties of transition metal oxides using density functional theory (DFT) calculations are essential for the computational design of energy materials. In this work, we investigate the anomalous reversal of the stability of structural distortions (where distorted structures go from being energetically favorable to sharply unfavorable relative to undistorted ones) induced by DFT+U on Mo d-orbitals in layered AMoO$_2$ (A = Li, Na, K) and rutile-like MoO$_2$. We highlight the significant impact of varying U$_{\text{eff}}$ values on the structural stability, convex hull, and thermodynamic stability predictions, noting that deviations can reach up to the order of 100 meV/atom across these energetic quantities. We find the transitions in stability are coincident with changes in the electron localization and magnetic behavior. The anomalous reversal persists across PBE, r$^2$SCAN functionals, and also with vdW-dispersion energy corrections (PBE+D3). In Mo-containing oxide systems, high U$_{\text{eff}}$ leads to inaccurate descriptions of physical quantities and structural relaxations under artificial symmetry constraints, as demonstrated by the phonon band structures, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional results, and comparisons with experimental structural data. We conclude that high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values (around 4 eV and above, depending on the specific structures and compositions) might be unsuitable for energetic predictions in A-Mo-O chemical spaces. Our results suggest that the common practice of applying DFT+U to convex hull constructions, especially with high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values derived from fittings, should be carefully evaluated to ensure that ground states are correctly reproduced, with careful consideration of dynamic stability and possible energetically favorable distortions.

arXiv:2501.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study finite-size effects in the Blume-Capel model through the analysis of the zeros of the partition function. We consider a complete graph and make use of the behaviour of the partition function zeros to elucidate the crossover from effective to asymptotic properties. While in the thermodynamic limit the exact solution yields the asymptotic mean-field behaviour, for finite system sizes an effective critical behaviour is observed. We show that even for large systems, the criticality is not asymptotic. We also present insights into how partition function zeros in different complex fields (temperature, magnetic field, crystal field) give different precision and provide us with different parts of the larger picture. This includes the differences between criticality and tricriticality as seen through the lens of Fisher, Lee-Yang, and Crystal Field zeros.

# Reflections of topological properties in the planar-Hall response for semimetals carrying pseudospin-1 quantum numbers

Abstract: We continue our investigations of the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar-Hall and planar-thermal Hall configurations, involving three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals, by considering here nodes hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles. Such systems exemplify multifold semimetals, as they have three bands crossing at a nodal point. We derive the explicit expressions of the electric, thermoelectric, and thermal coefficients, when the nodes are subjected to the combined influence of an electric field (and/or temperature gradient) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field. In order to have a complete description, we consider the effects of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment on an equal footing, both of which originate from the underlying topological features of the bandstructure. Going beyond our previous works, we determine the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, and chalk out the effects of internode-scatterings as well. Our theoretical explorations shed light on the mechanisms of transport in multifold semetals, which are being investigated in contemporary experiments.

Abstract: Higher-order skyrmions and antiskyrmions are topologically protected spin textures with an integer topological charge other than $\pm 1$ and nucleate from topological point defects in regular Bloch walls, known as vertical Bloch lines. So far, they have only been observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In this work, we show that higher-order spin textures coexisting in Co/Ni multilayers at room temperature can be visualized by high-resolution magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The experimental results are supported by micromagnetic simulations confirming that different spin objects give rise to distinct MFM contrast in full agreement to our observations.

Abstract: We performed high-resolution powder neutron diffraction experiments and discovered an elliptic helical incommensurate magnetic structure in the semiconducting rare-earth magnet YbCuS2, featuring effective spin-1/2 Yb$^{3+}$ ions that form a zigzag chain. Upon cooling the sample to 0.2 K, we observed very weak magnetic peaks indexed with an incommensurate propagation vector k = [0, 0.305, 0] along the zigzag chain. The magnitude of the magnetic moment is at least one-third smaller than the expected value for the Yb$^{3+}$ Kramers doublet ground state. In an applied magnetic field, up-up-down magnetic order was observed at 7.5 T, characterized by diffraction peaks indexed with k = [0, 1/3, 0] and substantial uniform magnetic components. These observations agree well with theoretical calculations based on the density matrix renormalization group for a zigzag spin-1/2 model with isotropic Heisenberg interactions and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$-type exchange interactions derived from material parameters. The theory elucidates the quantum mechanical nature of the incommensurate magnetism as remnant off-diagonal spin correlations in a nematic dimer-singlet state.

**Authors:** Xiyu Hong, Zhe Li

Abstract: Valley-based topological phases offer a wealth of exotic quantum states with tunable functionalities, driven by the valley degree of freedom. In this work, by constructing heterostructures of germanene (silicene, stanene) on various magnetic substrates, we address key tuning factors such as the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength of the substrate, magnetic orientations, and stacking orders, all of which govern multiple valley-based topological features. We present a comprehensive guiding principle for the efficient manipulation of these features, achieved simply by designing and modulating the magnetic properties of the underlying substrates. Specifically, increasing the SOC strength of the magnetic substrate acilitates a range of topological phase transitions characterized by different Chern numbers, with many systems exhibiting a transition from quantum valley Hall to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Additionally, rotating the in-plane magnetic orientation of the substrate enables tunability of the Chern number and chirality, within a moderate range of SOC strength. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic coupling of the magnetic substrate can induce valley-based QAH states with substantial valley gaps, leveraging its high Curie temperature (TC) to enable the realization of multiple tunable magnetic topologies at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a straightforward strategy for the design and manipulation of spintronic and valleytronic devices that can potentially operate under high-temperature conditions.

Abstract: We investigate experimentally and theoretically the behavior of the confined dark exciton in an InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot, under the application of an external magnetic field in Voigt configuration. We show that by varying the magnitude and direction of the external field one can accurately control the dark-exciton fine-structure splitting. In addition, we show that the dark-exciton spin state is approximately polarized along the cubic crystallographic directions [100] or equivalents. By comparing our experimental results with a model for the exchange and Zeeman interactions, we find the conditions for nullifying the fine-structure splitting between the two eigenstates of the dark exciton, thereby stopping its qubit precession.

Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a spin-liquid phase emerges from the interplay of strongly frustrated exchange interactions and subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects.

Abstract: Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.

Abstract: We propose a dephasing-tolerant protocol for quantum sensing of transverse magnetic fields which exploits spin qudit sensors with embedded fault-tolerant (FT) quantum error correction. By exploiting longitudinal drives, the transverse field induces logical Rabi oscillations between encoded states, whose frequency is linear in the transverse field to be probed. Numerical simulations show that the present FT protocol enables the detection of very small fields, orders of magnitudes below the limit imposed by the coherence time.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are foundational challenges in fields such as artificial intelligence, logistics, and network design. Traditional algorithms, including greedy methods and dynamic programming, often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality, particularly as problem complexity scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel and efficient probabilistic optimization framework that integrates true random number generators (TRNGs) based on spin-transfer torque magnetic tunneling junctions (STT-MTJs). The inherent stochastic switching behavior of STT-MTJs enables dynamic configurability of random number distributions, which we leverage to introduce controlled randomness into a probabilistic greedy algorithm. By tuning a temperature parameter, our algorithm seamlessly transitions between deterministic and stochastic strategies, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we apply this framework to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), showcasing its ability to consistently produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem scales. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both solution quality and convergence speed compared to classical approaches, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Specifically, in larger TSP instances involving up to 70 cities, it retains its performance advantage, achieving near-optimal solutions with fewer iterations and reduced computational costs. This work highlights the potential of integrating MTJ-based TRNGs into optimization algorithms, paving the way for future applications in probabilistic computing and hardware-accelerated optimization.

Abstract: Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ single crystals at sub-Kelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR-spectra between \SI{0}{\milli\tesla} and \SI{50}{\milli\tesla}. %We further analyze the linewidth narrowing of a hyperfine transition around its ZEFOZ point. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.

Abstract: Material challenges are the key issue in Majorana research where surface disorder constrains device performance. Here, we tackle this challenge by embedding PbTe nanowires within a lattice-constant-matched crystal. The wire edges are shaped by self-organized growth instead of lithography, resulting in nearly-atomic-flat facets along both cross-sectional and longitudinal directions. Quantized conductance is observed at zero magnetic field with channel lengths maximally reaching 1.7 $\mu$m, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art of III-V nanowires (an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to InSb). Coupling PbTe to a Pb film unveils a flat interface spanning microns and a large superconducting gap of 1 meV. Our result not only represents a stride toward meeting the stringent low-disorder requirement for Majoranas, but may also open the door to various hybrid quantum devices requiring a low level of disorder.

Abstract: The Hubbard model at temperatures above the N\'{e}el transition, despite being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover regime, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the Fermi liquid for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the location of the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methodology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can also serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.

Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional electron gas interacting with a quantized cavity mode. We find that the coupling between the electrons and the photons in the cavity enhances the superconducting gap. Crucially, all terms in the Peierls phase are kept, in contrast to more naive approaches, which may result in spurious superradiant phase transitions. We use a mean-field theory to show that the gap increases approximately linearly with the cavity coupling strength. The effect can be observed locally as an increase in the gap size via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements for a flake of a 2D material (or for a Moir\'e system where the enhancement is expected to be more pronounced due to a large lattice constant) interacting with a locally-structured electromagnetic field formed by split-ring resonators. Our results are also relevant for quantum optics setups with cold atoms interacting with the cavity mode, where the lattice geometry and system parameters can be tuned in a vast range.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the magnetization in magnetic semiconductors exhibits nutational motion when subjected to an external magnetic field. This behavior originates from the splitting of the conduction-electron band which induces anisotropic, distance-dependent exchange coupling between localized spins.
  To investigate this phenomenon, we examine a general system that includes both charge and spin degrees of freedom, characteristic of a magnetic semiconductor. This system is composed of two subsystems: (1) a gas of noninteracting conduction electrons and (2) a ferromagnetic array of localized spins, coupled through the Vonsovskii (\textit{sd}) local interaction. The entire system is subject to external electrical and magnetic disturbances. Through the Feynman-Schwinger formalism, we integrate out the faster (Grassmann) charge degrees of freedom associated with the conduction electrons to obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the localized spins in the form of an XXZ spin model. We then provide general analytical formulas for the corresponding anisotropic exchange couplings, expressed in Fourier and direct spaces, as functions of the effective field that induces conduction-band splitting.
  ....
  We hope this study will motivate further research into nutational phenomena in magnetic semiconductors, possibly resulting in improvements in the accurate control of magnetization dynamics within spin-based electronic devices.

Abstract: The ferroelectric domain structure of a freestanding BiFeO$_3$ film was visualized by ptychographic dichroic imaging with linearly polarized X-rays at the O K-edge around 530 eV. The dichroic contrast is maximized at the energy of the hybridization of the O 2p state and the Fe 3d orbitals, which is split by the octahedral crystal field of the perovskite structure. The microscopy images thus obtained complement the ptychographic imaging of the antiferromagnetic contribution at the Fe L$_3$-edge. The approach can be extended to the separation of different ferroic contributions in other multiferroic oxides.

Abstract: The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.

Abstract: Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional (3D) metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chain materials. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming that its magnetism is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point (QCP) separating different temperature T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. 1D magnetism dominates to the lowest T, and is barely affected by weak interchain coupling. Ti4MnBi2 is the first metallic spin chain where 3D conduction electrons become strongly correlated due to their coupling to 1D magnetic moments.

Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature-induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly laboratory-scale purification of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination using controllable cyclic temperature variations.

Abstract: We revisit the critical behavior of classical frustrated systems using the nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) equation. Our study is performed within the local potential approximation of this equation to which is added the flow of the field renormalization. Our flow equations are functional to avoid possible artifacts coming from the field expansion of the fixed point potential which consists in keeping only a limited number of coupling constants. We explain in detail our numerical implementation, its advantages and the difficulties encountered in the vicinity of $d=2$. For $N$-component spins, the function $N_c(d)$ separating the regions of first and second order transitions in the $(d,N)$ plane is computed for $d$ between 4 and 2.3. Our results confirm what was previously found with cruder approximations of the NPRG equation and contradict both the fixed dimension perturbative approach and some of the results obtained within the conformal bootstrap approach.

Abstract: We report on numerical simulations of the two-dimensional spin-$1$ Blume-Capel ferromagnet embedded in a triangular lattice. Utilizing a range of Monte Carlo and finite-size scaling techniques, we explore several critical aspects along the crystal field--temperature ($\Delta, T$) transition line. Wang-Landau simulations measuring the joint density of states in combination with the method of field mixing allow us to probe the phase coexistence curve in high resolution, determining the tricritical point $(\Delta_{\rm t}, T_{\rm t})$ with improved accuracy and verifying the tricritical exponents. Extensive multicanonical simulations identifying transition points across the phase diagram characterize the Ising universality class for $\Delta < \Delta_{\rm t}$ with precise determination of thermal and magnetic critical exponents expected in the second-order regime. On the other hand, for $\Delta > \Delta_{\rm t}$, a finite-size scaling analysis is dedicated to revealing the first-order signature in the surface tension that linearly increases upon lowering the temperature deeper into the first-order transition regime. Finally, a comprehensive picture of the phase diagram for the model is presented, collecting transition points obtained from the combined numerical approach in this study and previous estimates in the literature.

Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.

Abstract: Many theoretical models were come up with to figure out the properties of magnetic reconnection process, among which the Sweet-Parker model is the most famous since it describes the magnetic reconnection in a concise way. However, the low reconnection rate expected by this model is generally not available in most astrophysical systems, which motivates people to seek fast reconnection models. Under the scheme of generalized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for pair plasma, a fast magnetic reconnection model was established, in which the thermal electromotive force plays a key role to remarkably increase the reconnection rate. In this work, I would like to extend the discussions in my previous work, about the generally relativistic description of Sweet-Parker model, to the description of fast magnetic reconnection induced by thermal electromotive force. I will revisit the fast reconnection model briefly to initialize my discussions and show how the thermal electromotive force impacts the reconnection rate. Next, some basic setups will be exhibited before discussing specific examples about how the properties of fast magnetic reconnection are modified by gravitational effect or in observations. Results in this work consolidate my opinion reiterated in my previous work that properties of magnetic reconnection would never be modified by gravitational effect significantly if the magnetic reconnection process occurs in a local scale while the modifications of properties could not be neglected when the process is detected by an observer who is moving with respect to the laboratory, in the rest frame of which the magnetic reconnection occurs.

Abstract: Electromagnetic waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate deep into Earth's atmosphere, where they impart their temporal characteristics to diffuse aurorae. Using radar-observations of the ionospheric E-region and satellite observations from the magnetosphere, we demonstrate a close and unprecedented association between enhanced electrostatic cyclotron harmonic wave activity in the magnetosphere and the appearance of meter-scale ionospheric plasma turbulence observed a few seconds later in the lower ionosphere on nearby magnetic field lines.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are foundational challenges in fields such as artificial intelligence, logistics, and network design. Traditional algorithms, including greedy methods and dynamic programming, often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality, particularly as problem complexity scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel and efficient probabilistic optimization framework that integrates true random number generators (TRNGs) based on spin-transfer torque magnetic tunneling junctions (STT-MTJs). The inherent stochastic switching behavior of STT-MTJs enables dynamic configurability of random number distributions, which we leverage to introduce controlled randomness into a probabilistic greedy algorithm. By tuning a temperature parameter, our algorithm seamlessly transitions between deterministic and stochastic strategies, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we apply this framework to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), showcasing its ability to consistently produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem scales. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both solution quality and convergence speed compared to classical approaches, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Specifically, in larger TSP instances involving up to 70 cities, it retains its performance advantage, achieving near-optimal solutions with fewer iterations and reduced computational costs. This work highlights the potential of integrating MTJ-based TRNGs into optimization algorithms, paving the way for future applications in probabilistic computing and hardware-accelerated optimization.

Abstract: This article reports the development of a versatile high-speed reciprocating drive system (HRDS) with interchangeable probe heads to characterize the edge plasma region of ADITYA-U tokamak. This reciprocating probe drive system consisting of Langmuir and magnetic probe heads, is designed, fabricated, installed, and operated for studying the extent of fuel/impurity gas propagation and its influence on plasma dynamics in the far-edge region inside the last closed magnetic flux surface (LCFS). The HRDS is driven by a highly accurate, easy-to-control, dynamic, brushless, permanently excited synchronous servo motor operated by a PXI-commanded controller. The system is remotely operated and allows for precise control of the speed, acceleration, and distance traveled of the probe head on a shot-to-shot basis, facilitating seamless control of operations according to experimental requirements. Using this system, consisting of a linear array of Langmuir probes, measurements of plasma density, temperature, potential, and their fluctuations revealed that the fuel gas-puff impact these mean and fluctuating parameters up to three to four cm inside the LCFS. Attaching an array of magnetic probes to this system led to measurements of magnetic fluctuations inside the LCFS. The HRDS system is fully operational and serves as an important diagnostic tool for ADITYA-U tokamak.

Abstract: Magnetization switching by charge current without a magnetic field is essential for device applications and information technology. It generally requires a current-induced out-of-plane spin polarization beyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy-metal systems, where the current-induced spin polarization aligns in-plane orthogonal to the in-plane charge current and out-of-plane spin current. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for magnetic-field-free switching by fabricating a van-der-Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3 heterostructure. This new magnetic-field-free switching is possible because the current-driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interface precess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing an ultimate out-of-plane spin polarization. This interpretation is further confirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in-plane initialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. We successfully combined van-der-Waals magnet and oxide for the first time, especially taking advantage of spin-orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allows us to establish a new way of magnetic field-free switching. Our work demonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of large spin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and in doing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van-der-Waals magnets and oxide spintronics.

Abstract: Accurate predictions of the properties of transition metal oxides using density functional theory (DFT) calculations are essential for the computational design of energy materials. In this work, we investigate the anomalous reversal of the stability of structural distortions (where distorted structures go from being energetically favorable to sharply unfavorable relative to undistorted ones) induced by DFT+U on Mo d-orbitals in layered AMoO$_2$ (A = Li, Na, K) and rutile-like MoO$_2$. We highlight the significant impact of varying U$_{\text{eff}}$ values on the structural stability, convex hull, and thermodynamic stability predictions, noting that deviations can reach up to the order of 100 meV/atom across these energetic quantities. We find the transitions in stability are coincident with changes in the electron localization and magnetic behavior. The anomalous reversal persists across PBE, r$^2$SCAN functionals, and also with vdW-dispersion energy corrections (PBE+D3). In Mo-containing oxide systems, high U$_{\text{eff}}$ leads to inaccurate descriptions of physical quantities and structural relaxations under artificial symmetry constraints, as demonstrated by the phonon band structures, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional results, and comparisons with experimental structural data. We conclude that high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values (around 4 eV and above, depending on the specific structures and compositions) might be unsuitable for energetic predictions in A-Mo-O chemical spaces. Our results suggest that the common practice of applying DFT+U to convex hull constructions, especially with high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values derived from fittings, should be carefully evaluated to ensure that ground states are correctly reproduced, with careful consideration of dynamic stability and possible energetically favorable distortions.

Abstract: Novel methods and technology drive the rapid advances of nuclear magnetic resonance. The primary objective of developing novel hardware is to improve sensitivity and reliability (and possibly to reduce cost). Automation has made NMR much more convenient to use than before, but it may lead to trusting the algorithms without regular checks. In this contribution, we analyzed the signal and SNR as a function of the receiver gain (RG) for 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei on three devices. On a 1 T benchtop spectrometer (Spinsolve, Magritek), the SNR showed the expected increase as a function of RG. Still, the 1H and 13C signal amplitudes deviated by up to 50% from supposedly RG-independent signal intensities. On 7 and 9.4 T spectrometers (Avance Neo, Bruker), the signal showed the expected approximately linear increase with RG, but we found an unexpected, drastic drop of SNR for X-nuclei: For example, while RG = 18 provided a 13C SNR similar to that at a maximum RG of 101, the obtained SNR was 46% higher than at RG = 20.2. These unexpected results suggest that NMR users may want to calibrate spectrometer settings to obtain the optimum SNR for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not account for the observed characteristics. In this context, we provide a method to estimate optimal settings for thermally and hyperpolarized samples of a chosen concentration, polarization, and flip angle, which provide a high SNR and avoid ADC-overflow artifacts.

Abstract: The goal of the FNAL E989 experiment is to measure the muon magnetic anomaly to unprecedented accuracy and precision at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. To meet this goal, the time and space averaged magnetic environment in the muon storage volume must be known to better than 70 ppb. A new pulsed proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnetometer was designed and built at the University of Washington, Seattle to track the temporal stability of the 1.45T magnetic field in the muon storage ring at this precision. It consists of an array of 378 petroleum jelly based NMR probes that are embedded in the walls of muon storage ring vacuum chambers and custom electronics built with readily available modular radio frequency (RF) components. We give NMR probe construction details and describe the functions of the custom electronic subsystems. The excellent performance metrics of the magnetometer are discussed, where after 8 years of operation the median single shot resolution of the array of probes remains at 650 ppb.

Abstract: We develop a full-wave electromagnetic (EM) theory for calculating the multipole decomposition in two-dimensional (2-D) structures consisting of isolated, arbitrarily shaped, inhomogeneous, anisotropic cylinders or a collection of such. To derive the multipole decomposition, we first solve the scattering problem by expanding the scattered electric field in divergenceless cylindrical vector wave functions (CVWF) with unknown expansion coefficients that characterize the multipole response. These expansion coefficients are then expressed via contour integrals of the vectorial components of the scattered electric field evaluated via an electric field volume integral equation (EFVIE). The kernels of the EFVIE are the products of the tensorial 2-D Green's function (GF) expansion and the equivalent 2-D volumetric electric and magnetic current densities. We validate the theory using the commercial finite element solver COMSOL Multiphysics. In the validation, we compute the multipole decomposition of the fields scattered from various 2-D structures and compare the results with alternative formulations. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the theory to study an emerging photonics application on oligomers-based highly directional switching using active media. This analysis addresses a critical gap in current literature, where multipole theories exist primarily for three-dimensional (3-D) particles of isotropic materials. Our work enhances the understanding and utilization of the optical properties of 2-D, inhomogeneous, and anisotropic cylindrical structures, contributing to advancements in photonic and meta-optics technologies.

Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field strength, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations (correlation coefficient = 0.78). During geospace storms, then, turbulent structuring as well as fast electrodynamics in the dayside polar ionosphere can be driven by wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient and time-accurate three-dimensional (3D) single-fluid MHD solar coronal model and employ it to simulate CME evolution and propagation. Based on a quasi-steady-state implicit MHD coronal model, we developed an efficient time-accurate coronal model that can be used to speed up the CME simulation by selecting a large time-step size. We have called it the Solar Interplanetary Phenomena-Implicit Finite Volume Method (SIP-IFVM) coronal model. A pseudo-time marching method was implemented to improve temporal accuracy. A regularised Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL) flux rope, whose axis can be designed into an arbitrary shape, was inserted into the background corona to trigger the CME event. We performed a CME simulation on the background corona of Carrington rotation (CR) 2219 and evaluated the impact of time-step sizes on simulation results. Our study demonstrates that this model is able to simulate the CME evolution and propagation process from the solar surface to $20\; R_s$ in less than 0.5 hours (192 CPU cores, $\sim$ 1 M cells). Compared to the explicit counterpart, this implicit coronal model is not only faster, but it also has improved numerical stability. We also conducted an ad hoc simulation with initial magnetic fields artificially increased. It shows that this model can effectively deal with time-dependent low-$\beta$ problems ($\beta<10^{-4}$). Additionally, an Orszag-Tang MHD vortex flow simulation demonstrates that the pseudo-time-marching method used in this coronal model can simulate small-scale unsteady-state flows. The simulation results show that this MHD coronal model is very efficient and numerically stable. It is a promising approach to simulating time-varying events in the solar corona with low plasma $\beta$ in a timely and accurate manner.

Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature-induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly laboratory-scale purification of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination using controllable cyclic temperature variations.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.

Paramagnetic molybdenum compounds are of great interest in 4d-metal inorganic chemistry and metalloenzyme catalysis. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies that determine hyperfine coupling parameters and g values are essential tools for investigating the local and global electronic structure of these compounds. Such studies require support from accurate quantum chemical approaches to establish reliable structure–spectroscopy correlations. Here we present a curated database of 22 molecular Mo complexes with well-defined structures and EPR parameters and investigate quantum chemical approaches to determine optimal protocols for computing 95Mo hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) and g values of Mo(V) compounds. It is shown that the SARC all-electron basis sets developed for the Douglas–Kroll–Hess (DKH) Hamiltonian can be used without any adaptation also for the exact-2-component (X2C) Hamiltonian and require no modifications to produce excellent and converged results for both HFCs and g values. The dependence of EPR parameters on the functional is studied in detail. Double-hybrid functionals and global hybrids with high percentage of exact exchange are top performers for 95Mo HFCs, with PBE0-DH achieving the best agreement with experiment. The DFT results on HFCs are compared with values obtained by coupled cluster theory with the domain-based local pair natural orbital approach (DLPNO-CCSD) and we show that the latter falls short in terms of accuracy and consistency compared to the best performing functionals for the preset set of compounds. Smaller differentiation among functionals is observed for the calculation of g tensors, with double hybrids being surpassed by several global and range-separated hybrid functionals, although PBE0-DH is still a top performer and can thus be recommended as the most reliable DFT approach overall for both valence and core properties of Mo compounds.

**Authors:** Yuki, Kurashige

Polarized electron spins in photoexcited triplet states enable dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) at high temperatures, leading to increased sensitivity in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For a practical nuclear polarization of 10%, single crystals must be precisely oriented in a magnetic field to generate electron spin resonances in a narrow field range that satisfies resonance conditions for polarization transfer. However, this is not realistic for medical applications. Substituted fullerenes as triplet polarizing agents have enabled 1H polarizations above 10%, even for random molecular orientations. They have not been used as polarizing agents for triplet-DNP because of electron spin relaxation via pseudo-rotation. Here, the spin-lattice relaxation time was significantly increased by chemical modification of two sites on C60 fullerenes. Symmetry considerations revealed fullerenes that avoided pseudo-rotations. Di-substituted fullerenes were ideal polarizing agents with sharp linewidths and long relaxation times that enabled 14.2% 1H polarization in randomly oriented orientations. Optimized polarizing agents would enable ultra-sensitive MRI medical diagnostics under mild preparation conditions.

# Research on a novel hybrid single cavity structure for cancer therapy

## 用于肿瘤治疗的新型混合型单腔结构研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5780790/latest

In recent decades, significant advancements have been made in accelerator technology, particularly with the hybrid single cavity (HSC). The HSC technology combines a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) and a drift tubes linac (DTL) within a unified interdigital H-type (IH) structure, resulting in enhanced compactness and system simplification. However, this design presents two fundamental challenges: reduced beam transmission efficiency and the concentration of electromagnetic (EM) fields at the matching section between RFQ and DTL sections. To address these issues, a novel coupled-window structure (CWS) has been devised to mitigate the effects of the EM fields. This paper explores the design and optimization of a 100 MHz HSC for high intensity carbon beam cancer therapy. The new HSC cavity is engineered to accelerate 20 mA C6+ beams from 20 keV/u to 4 MeV/u within a distance of 4.4 m, achieving a total transmission efficiency of 91%. These outcomes are attainable through the implementation of CWS, which effectively mitigates the challenges associated with matching dynamic fields between the RFQ and DTL sections.

Magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising precursors for generating diverse carbon-based nanostructures due to their facile recovery and separation, as well as their robust mechanical and thermal properties. In this study, a novel Cu-Co bimetallic nanoparticle supported on magnetic MOF derived N-doped carbon was successfully synthesized. The copper ions preloaded within the pores of the Co MOF provide abundant exposed Cu active sites. The pyrolysis treatment results in a hierarchical porous structure with a high surface area, contributing to mass transfer and enhancing reactant diffusion to the active sites. The developed catalyst was characterized extensively using FT-IR, XRD, BET, BJH, EDX, TGA, VSM, FE-SEM, ICP, and XPS techniques. The catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic activity for C-N coupling and one-pot multicomponent reactions. This superior performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between copper nanoparticles incorporated in the composite, as well as the highly porous N-doped carbon structure. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable stability, maintaining its activity without significant degradation after five consecutive reaction cycles. This innovative approach, capitalizing on the reinforcing interplay of structural and compositional advantages, opens up opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts supported on magnetic MOF-derived N-doped carbon.
