An exchange-bias field remembers the last saturated state, due to the localized magnetic spring at the interface. These results provide a basis for reconfigurable domain-wall racetracks in which the propagation direction can be controlled by magnetic history and applied fields.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRAPPLIED/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.23.014023.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

Abstract: In Refs.[1-4] Dirac and Schwinger showed the existence of a magnetic monopole required a charge quantization condition which we write following Dirac as $\frac{eg}{4\pi\hbar}=\frac{n}{2},\; n=0,\pm 1,\; \pm 2, \ldots$. Here, $g$ is the magnetic monopole charge and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron. Recently, in Refs. [5,6], it has been shown experimentally that frustrated spin-ice systems exhibit 'emergent' magnetic monopoles. We show that, within the experimental errors, the respective magnetic charges obey the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition. Possible implications are discussed.

Abstract: We investigate the Cr electronic structure and excitations in CrSBr, a layered magnetic semiconductor, using a combination of resonant x-ray spectroscopic techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra collected at the Cr $L_{2,3}$ edges reveal significant linear dichroism, which arises from the distorted octahedral environment surrounding the Cr$^{3+}$ ions. The origin of the bright excitons observed in this compound is examined through a comparison of the d-d excitations identified in the RIXS spectra, the x-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectra, and previously reported optical spectroscopic and theoretical studies. To further understand these phenomena, we develop a multiplet model based on a crystal electric field (CEF) approach that accounts for the local environment of Cr ions. This model successfully reproduces several experimental features, while also suggesting strong hybridization effects between Cr 3\textit{d} orbitals and ligands that are not fully captured by the present framework. These findings advance our understanding of the electronic structure and excitonic behavior in CrSBr and provide a foundation for future $\textit{in-situ}$ and $\textit{operando}$ studies of CrSBr-based devices for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.

# Spectroscopy of the Fractal Hofstadter Energy Spectrum

arXiv:2501.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hofstadter's butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter's butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter's butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants, such as those with moir\'e superlattices. Yet to-date, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy (STM / STS) to probe the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene near the predicted second magic angle, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter's spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moir\'e bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, displaying phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter's original model due to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions, and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in twisted bilayer graphene.

Abstract: We report the magnetoelastic properties of a Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$ single crystal at low temperatures under a magnetic field applied along the crystallographic [001] axis. Our results extend to low temperature the $H-T$ phase diagram determined for this compound by neutron scattering. Furthermore, we observe that specific elastic modes are better sensitive to the various magnetic transitions. In particular, we observe an unusual coupling between the in-plane transverse acoustic mode and the cycloidal order at low field, which suggests a novel spin-strain mechanism originating from Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in this compound.

Abstract: We study the two-dimensional extended Hubbard model on a square lattice and incorporate spin-differentiated nearest neighbor (NN) interactions where the equal-spin ($V_{uu}$) and unequal-spin ($V_{ud}$) terms are independently tuned parameters. We compute single-particle excitations as well as static spin and pairing susceptibilities perturbatively up to the fourth order within the thermodynamic limit and at a finite fixed temperature. By explicitly encoding a ferromagnetic-like NN interaction ($V_{uu} < V_{ud}$), we induce a competition among the uniform $q = (0,0)$, collinear $q = (\pi,0)$, and staggered $q = (\pi,\pi)$ spin excitations. This results in the formation of short-ranged $2\times 2$ ferromagnetic plaquettes arranged in staggered or striped patterns. Kinetic frustration in hopping, both within and between these plaquettes, manifests in single-particle properties, resulting in a reduction of bandwidth and ultimately triggering a Lifshitz transition to quasi-one-dimensional bands. Furthermore, an attractive effective interaction within the localized ferromagnetic plaquette results in the emergence of equal-spin triplet $p$-wave pairing. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong magnetic fluctuations, even at finite length scales, can significantly influence single-particle and pairing properties without breaking translational symmetry. Our approach provides a novel pathway to realize a variety of rich magnetic phases and Fermi surface reconstruction driven by interactions in the absence of explicit geometric frustration.

# Adiabatic Pumping of Orbital Magnetization by Spin Precession

arXiv:2501.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose adiabatic pumping of orbital magnetization driven by coherent spin precession, facilitating the rectification of this precession. The orbital magnetization originates from the adiabatic evolution of valence electrons with a topological bulk contribution expressed as a Chern-Simons form. When the precession cone angle of spin $\bm{S}$ is small, the resulting magnetization is proportional to $\bm{S}\times \dot{\bm{S}}$, contributing to the magnon Zeeman effect. With a large cone angle, the magnetization can reach its natural unit, $e/T$, in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator with $e$ as the elementary charge and $T$ as the precession period. This significant magnetization is related to the global properties of the electronic geometric phases in the parameter space spanned by $\bm{S}$ and momentum $\bm{k}$. When the pumped magnetization is inhomogeneous, induced by spin textures or electronic topological phase domains, a dissipationless charge current is also pumped. At last, we discuss the boundary contributions from the spin-driving edge states, which are intricately linked to the gauge-dependent quantum uncertainty of the Chern-Simons form.

arXiv:2501.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetoelectric properties of the monolayer NiX$_{2}$ (X = Br, I) through first-principles calculations. Our calculations predict that the NiBr$_{2}$ monolayer exhibits a cycloidal magnetic ground state. For the NiI$_{2}$ monolayer, a proper-screw helical magnetic ground state with modulation vector \(\boldsymbol{Q} = (q, 0, 0)\) is adopted, approximated based on experimental observations. The electric polarization in NiBr$_{2}$ shows a linear dependence on the spin-orbit coupling strength \(\lambda_{\text{SOC}}\), which can be adequately described by the generalized Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky (gKNB) model, considering contributions from up to the third nearest-neighbor spin pairs. In contrast, the electric polarization in NiI$_{2}$ exhibits a distinct dependence on \(q\) and \(\lambda_{\text{SOC}}\), which cannot be fully explained by the gKNB mechanism alone. To address this, the \(p\)-\(d\) hybridization mechanism is extended to NiI$_{2}$ to explain the observed behavior. The respective contributions from the \(p\)-\(d\) hybridization and the gKNB mechanism in NiI$_{2}$ are then quantitatively evaluated. Overall, our work elucidates the microscopic mechanisms underlying multiferroicity in NiBr$_{2}$ and NiI$_{2}$ monolayers, with the conclusions readily applicable to their bulk forms.

Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that are often traced to a complex interplay among different microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulating the dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.

arXiv:2501.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different mechanisms of magnetization reversal in finite-length Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface have been investigated, taking into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It has been found that the magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through the simultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, the magnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by the formation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co and Fe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors have been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of these prefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significant and non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitatively describes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers and the frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from our theoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results of numerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimation of the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths, temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters. The proposed theoretical framework is applicable not only to the Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface but also to a broad class of one-dimensional magnetic systems.

Abstract: Using Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we study the rich dynamics in magnetic disks and rings governed by non-linear interactions, focusing on the role of vortex core dynamics on the spin-wave eigenmode spectrum. By strongly exciting quantized magnon modes in magnetic vortices, self-induced magnon Floquet states are populated by the intrinsic nonlinear coupling of magnon modes to the vortex core gyration. In magnetic rings, however, this generation is suppressed even when exciting the system over a large power range. To retrieve the rich nonlinear dynamics in rings, we apply external in-plane magnetic fields by which the vortex core is restored. Our findings demonstrate how to take active control of the nonlinear processes in magnetic structures of different topology.

Abstract: Topological defects play a critical role across many fields, mediating phase transitions and macroscopic behaviors as they move through space. Their role as robust information carriers has also generated much attention. However, controlling their motion remains challenging, especially towards achieving motion along well-defined paths which typically require predefined structural patterning. Here we demonstrate the tunable, unidirectional motion of topological defects, specifically magnetic dislocations in a weak magnetic stripe pattern, induced by external magnetic field in a laterally unconfined thin film. This motion is shown to mediate the overall continuous rotation of the stripe pattern. We determine the connection between the unidirectional motion of dislocations and the underlying three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure by performing 3D magnetic vectorial imaging with in situ magnetic fields. A minimal model for dislocations in stripe patterns that encodes the symmetry breaking induced by the external magnetic field reproduces the motion of dislocations that facilitate the 2D rotation of the stripes, highlighting the universality of the phenomenon. This work establishes a framework for studying the field-driven behavior of topological textures and designing materials that enable well defined, controlled motion of defects in unconfined systems, paving the way to manipulate information carriers in higher-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We report the synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetic properties of a new Kitaev honeycomb cobaltate, KCoAsO$_4$, which crystallizes in two distinct forms: $P2/c$ and $R\bar{3}$ space groups. Magnetic measurements reveal ordering temperatures of $\sim$14 K for the $P2/c$ structure and $\sim$10.5 K for the $R\bar{3}$ structure. The $P2/c$-type KCoAsO$_4$ sample exhibits a complex temperature-field phase diagram, including a field-induced phase, while the $R\bar{3}$-type KCoAsO$_4$ shows a simpler phase diagram with a single magnetically ordered phase. The observed differences in magnetic properties are attributed to subtle structural variations, strongly suggesting that local structural changes play a crucial role in determining the magnetism of cobaltate-based Kitaev materials.

Abstract: We investigated magnetization, muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), and $^{119}Sn$ M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy on Sn substituted $CuCr_{2-x}Sn_xS_4$ (x=0.03 and 0.08) spinel compounds. The magnetization and $\mu$SR results reveal similar additional low-temperature magnetic transitions around 80 K and 40 K as found for the undoped material, indicating a magnetic ground state deviating from a simple collinear ferromagnet. The observed changes in the M\"{o}ssbauer hyperfine spectra are less pronounced and are discussed in view of the different positions of the local probes $\mu^+$ and $^{119}Sn$ and their different magnetic coupling to the magnetic Cr lattice. Above 80 K, both $\mu$SR and M\"{o}ssbauer spectra show temperature-dependent inhomogeneous broadening either due to structural or charge disorder and changing spin dynamics that can be related to a precursor magnetic phase above the well-defined static low-temperature phase.

arXiv:2501.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.

Abstract: Determining the electronic phase diagram of a quantum material as a function of temperature (T) and applied magnetic field (H) forms the basis for understanding the microscopic origin of transport properties, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and topological Hall effect (THE). For many magnetic quantum materials, including EuAl$_4$, a THE arises from a topologically protected magnetic skyrmion lattice with a non-zero scalar spin chirality. We identified a square skyrmion lattice (sSkL) peak in Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ ($x$ = 0.9) identical to the peak previously observed in EuAl$_4$ by performing neutron scattering measurements throughout the phase diagram. Comparing these neutron results with transport measurements, we found that in both compounds the maximal THE does not correspond to the sSkL area. Instead of the maximal THE, the maximal magnetocaloric effect (MCE) boundaries better identify the sSkL lattice phase observed by neutron scattering measurements. The maximal THE therefore arises from interactions of itinerant electrons with frustrated spin fluctuations in a topologically trivial magnetic state.

Abstract: The intercalation of molecular species between the layers of van der Waals (vdW) materials has recently emerged as a powerful approach to combine the remarkable electronic and magnetic properties of vdW materials with the chemical flexibility of organic molecules. However, the full transformative potential of molecular intercalation remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of simple, broadly applicable methods that preserve high crystalline quality down to the few-layer limit. Here, we introduce a simple galvanic approach to intercalate different molecules into various vdW materials under ambient conditions, leveraging the low reduction potential of selected metals to enable a spontaneous molecular insertion. We employ our method, which is particularly well-suited for the in-situ intercalation of few-layer-thick crystals, to intercalate nine vdW materials, including magnets and superconductors, with molecules ranging from conventional alkylammonium ions to metallorganic and bio-inspired chiral cations. Notably, intercalation leads to a molecule-dependent enhancement of the superconducting transition in 2H-TaS2, reaching a critical temperature of 4.7 K, higher than TaS2 monolayers. Additionally, RuCl3 exhibits an unprecedented transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic ordering upon intercalation with cobaltocenium. These results establish our approach as a versatile technique for engineering atomically thin quantum materials and heterostructures, unlocking the transformative effects of molecular intercalation.

arXiv:2501.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently-synthesised MoSi2N4 is the first septuple layer two-dimensional material, which doesn't naturally occurs as a layered crystal, and has been obtained with CVD growth. It can be considered as MoN2 crystal (with a crystal structure of MoS2) intercalating Si2N2 two-dimensional layer (with the structure similar to InSe). Such classification gave rise to the understanding of the electronic properties of the material, but also to the prediction of other members of the family (many dozens of them) as well as to the way to classify those. Whereas the originally-synthesised MoSi2N4 is a semiconductor, some of the members of the family are also metallic and some even demonstrate magnetic properties. Interestingly, the room-temperature mobility predicted for such crystals can be as high few thousands cm^2/V*s (hole mobility typically higher than electron) with some record cases as high as 5*10^4 cm^22/V*s, making these materials strong contenders for future electronic applications. The major interest towards these materials is coming from the septuple layer structure, which allows multiple crystal phases, but also complex compositions, in particular those with broken mirror-reflection symmetry against the layer of metal atoms.

arXiv:2501.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons with non-zero Hopf index ${\cal H}$ in the vector field of material's local magnetization. In this Letter elliptical stability of hopfions with ${\cal H}=1$ in a classical helimagnet is studied on the basis of a variational model. It is shown that, depending on their internal structure (vortex and antivortex tubes ordering), the hopfions can either be stable in a bulk magnet or unstable with respect to elongation along their central axis. It is found that the energy of stable hopfions is always below the energy of the $2\pi$-skyrmion lattice in the same material, suggesting the possibility to use $2\pi$-skyrmions as a precursor for hopfion nucleation. Stability diagram for hopfions on the magnetic anisotropy-field phase diagram is computed numerically. Explicit analytical expressions for some of its critical lines are derived.

Abstract: While $Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2$ (HZO) thin films hold significant promise for modern nanoelectronic devices, a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between their polycrystalline structure and electrical properties remains elusive. Here, we present a novel framework combining phase-field (PF) modeling with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to uncover structure-property correlations in polycrystalline HZO. Leveraging PF simulations, we constructed a high-fidelity dataset of $P-V$ loops by systematically varying critical material parameters, including grain size, polar grain fraction, and crystalline orientation. The VAEs effectively encoded hysteresis loops into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing electrical properties while disentangling complex material parameters interdependencies. We further demonstrate a VAE-based inverse design approach to optimize $P-V$ loop features, enabling the tailored design of device-specific key performance indicators (KPIs), including coercive field, remanent polarization, and loop area. The proposed approach offers a pathway to systematically explore and optimize the material design space for ferroelectric nanoelectronics.

arXiv:2501.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AFE-PUND, a revisited Positive Up Negative Down (PUND) protocol for characterizing antiferroelectric (AFE) materials, in analyzing $ZrO_2$ films across different thicknesses, revealing key trends. The proposed AFE-PUND method enables the isolation of switching currents from non-switching contributions, allowing precise extraction of remanent polarization and coercive field from hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization increases with film thickness, reflecting enhanced domain stability, while endurance cycles highlight the wake-up effect and its eventual degradation due to fatigue in thicker films. Similarly, coercive fields decrease with thickness, indicating reduced switching barriers and a clearer transition between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. The method provides valuable insights into micro-structural influences, such as defect accumulation, grain size, and domain wall pinning, which critically affect device performance. AFE-PUND thus establishes itself as an essential tool for advancing the understanding and optimization of antiferroelectric materials.

Abstract: The manipulation of electronic structure through periodic electric fields enables the reversible control of effective interactions in extended antiferromagnetic Mott insulators on ultrafast timescales. A careful analytical examination of the modulated effective interactions is conducted, accurately characterising it through the use of exact summation formulas and Bessel functions. As a result, time reversals are analytically determined in terms of Bessel zeroes. We discuss the half-filled Hubbard model, as well as multi-orbital models, various characteristics of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, and the emergence of chiral spin terms.

Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy of Andreev subgap states in hybrid nanowires with a thin superconducting full-shell surrounding a semiconducting core. The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.

**Authors:** Pritam Chatterjee, Vladimir Juri\v{c}i\'c

arXiv:2501.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay between altermagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both chiral and helical phases. Our study reveals that the emergence of helical and chiral Majorana states can be tuned by the amplitude of a $d-$wave altermagnetic order parameter, with the outcome depending on the nature of the superconducting state. In the helical superconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition into a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes (MFEMs). On the other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes place between a topologically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line superconductor, where the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect at an isolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that when such an altermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and helical components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive Majorana edge that modes coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states. Our findings therefore establish a novel platform for controlling and manipulating Majorana modes in unconventional superconductors with vanishing total magnetization.

Abstract: Built upon the previous work on the 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism invariants (namely, 5d invertible field theory [iTFT] or symmetry-protected topological state [SPTs]) of the Standard Model [SM] gauge theory with compatible (SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1))/$\mathbb{Z}_q$ gauge group for $q=1,2,3,6$, we further enumerate lower-dimensional iTFT / SPTs in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the 4d SPTs are interesting gapped phases attachable to the SM, those integer classes of SPTs (either the torsion or the free cobordism class) are not universal and are difficult to detect. However, fractional SPTs are more universal and can be detected by a topological response similar to the Hall conductance under an appropriate symmetry twist background field. We find a nontrivial symmetry-extension from a magnetic 1-symmetry U(1)$_{[1]}^m$ by an electric 1-symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{6/q,[1]}^e$ introducing the $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{6/q}$ fractionalization class. While we also introduce the background fields for Baryon minus Lepton number $({\bf B}-{\bf L})$ like 0-symmetries of U(1)$_{{\bf Q} - N_c {\bf L}}$, U(1)$_X$, and $\mathbb{Z}_{4,X}$, that introduces two more data $\alpha \in 1,3$ and $\beta \in 1,5$ for the SMs. We present their Hall conductance response data (denoted as $\sigma, \sigma'$, and $\sigma''$ respectively), between 0-symmetry and 1-symmetry background fields, and show their fractional dependence on the SM data $(q,\alpha,\beta, k)$.

Abstract: Analytically solving the magnetostatic Maxwell equations in the bispherical coordinates, we calculate the magnetic field around two uniformly magnetized spheres oriented so that their magnetic moments are parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the spheres. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is often claimed in the literature, the magnetic interaction between such spheres is not equivalent to the interaction between two point magnetic dipoles placed in the centers of the spheres. The nonzero levitation force acting on a uniformly magnetized sphere or a point magnetic dipole above a superconducting sphere in the ideal Meissner state is a clear manifestation of the non-equivalence.

Abstract: We present magneto-optical studies of a self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot in neutral and positively charged states. The diamagnetic shifts and Zeeman splitting of many well-identified optical transitions are precisely measured. Remarkably, a pronounced negative diamagnetic shift is observed for spectral lines resulting from a doubly positively charged excitonic complex. We use the Hartree - Fock approximation for describing the direct Coulomb and exchange interactions between the quantum dot confined carriers in various configurations. A simple harmonic potential model, which we extend to capture the influence of an externally applied magnetic field in Faraday configuration, is then used to quantitatively account for all the measured diamagnetic shifts. We show that the negative shift is due to the change in the hole-hole exchange interaction energy induced by the magnetic field. Using this model and the measured shifts we extract the dielectric constant of the quantum dot material and get a decent estimate of the quantum dot dimensions. Further, the measured Zeeman splitting of the various spectral lines are also explained by a simple model using algebraic sums and differences of the $g$-factors of the confined charge carriers in their respective first and second discrete energy levels. Finally, the obtained values of the electronic $g$-factor and that of the dielectric constant are independently used to determine the effective composition (x) of the ternary In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As quantum dot. Both agree to within the experimental uncertainties.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit spontaneous magnetization, polarization or strain (referred to as ferroics) have the potential to revolutionize nanotechnology by enhancing the multifunctionality of nanoscale devices. However, multiferroic order is difficult to achieve, requiring complicated coupling between electron and spin degrees of freedom. We propose a universal method to engineer multiferroics from van der Waals magnets by taking advantage of the fact that changing the stacking between 2D layers can break inversion symmetry, resulting in ferroelectricity and possibly magnetoelectric coupling. We illustrate this concept using first-principles calculations in bilayer NiI$_2$, which can be made ferroelectric upon rotating two adjacent layers by $180^{\circ}$ with respect to the bulk stacking. Furthermore, we discover a novel multiferroic order induced by interlayer charge transfer which couples the interlayer spin order and electronic polarization. Our approach is not only general but also systematic, and can enable the discovery of a wide variety of 2D multiferroics.

Abstract: This study presents systematic investigations into the growth and physical properties of EuAl$_3$Si single crystals, encompassing magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic analyses. EuAl$_3$Si undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at $T_C$ = 15 K. A significant reversible magnetocaloric effect was observed around $T_C$. Strikingly, with a small change of magnetic field 2 T, the maximum values of magnetic entropy change (13.4 J/kg K), refrigerant capacity (166 J/kg) and adiabatic temperature change (7.2 K) are found. These parameters respectively are 60%, 148% and 64% larger than those of the parent compound EuAl$_4$, and suggest EuAl$_3$Si as an excellent candidate for magnetic refrigeration applications near the temperature of liquid hydrogen. The possible mechanism for this enhancement is also discussed.

Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of CrTe$_2$ within the density functional theory (DFT) approach in ferromagnetic phase and combination of DFT and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in paramagnetic phase. We show that few layer CrTe$_2$ possesses well formed local magnetic moments. In the single layer CrTe$_2$ we find antiferromagnetic exchange with 120\degree antiferromagnetic structure most preferable. In the bilayer and trilayer systems electronic correlations in DFT+DMFT approach yield ferromagnetic exchange interaction within each layer, but the interaction between the layers is antiferromagnetic, such that alternation of the direction of magnetization of the layers is expected. In bulk CrTe$_2$ we find the tendency to ferromagnetic order at low temperature, but with increase of temperature antiferromagnetic correlations between the layers dominate. Determination of the critical number of layers at which the interlayer antiferromagnetic order changes to the ferromagnetic one, likely requires consideration of the non-local Coulomb interactions.

Abstract: Conductor materials with good mechanical performance as well as high electrical- and thermal-conductivities are particularly important to break through the current bottle-neck limit ($\sim 100$ T) of pulsed magnets. Here we perform systematic studies on the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires, a promising candidate material for the new-generation pulsed magnets, by employing two independent ultrasonic techniques - resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and ultrasound pulse-echo experiments. Our RUS measurements manifest that the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires can be improved by an electroplastic drawing procedure as compared with the conventional cold drawing. We also take this chance to test the availability of our newly-built ultrasound pulse-echo facility at Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC, China), and the results suggest that the elastic performance of the electroplastically-drawn Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wire remains excellent without anomalous softening under extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-high magnetic field up to 50 T, nitrogen / helium cryogenic liquids.

Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is a phenomenon of thermoelectric generation that occurs within a device consisting of a bilayer of a metal and a ferromagnet. When Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) is substituted for the ferromagnet, the effect goes to zero at low temperatures, yet it increases to positive values with the application of a magnetic field. This is opposite to the expectation that the SSE should be suppressed by a magnetic field due to the increase in the magnon gap. In this paper, the crystal-field excitations (CFE) in TbIG are calculated within a mean field theory exploiting the parameters of Terbium Gallium Garnet Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (TGG) from the neutron-scattering experimental literature. Like TGG, the primitive cell of TbIG hosts twelve Tb sites with six inequivalent magnetic sublattices, but due to the net $[111]$-molecular field from the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe ions, these can be classified into two distinct groups, the $\mathbf{C}$ and the $\mathbf{C'}$ sites, which account for the `double umbrella' magnetic structure. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied along the [111] direction of the crystal, the lowest CFE of the $\mathbf{C}$ sublattices decreases. As a consequence of the magnetic field dependence of the lowest CFE, we find that at low temperatures the SSE in TbIG can result enhanced by an applied magnetic field.

Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.

Abstract: This paper analyzes a peculiar phenomenon of non-reciprocal domain wall pairs and illustrate the implications in ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments with (112)-oriented planar R180 domain walls within the canonical multiferroic ferroelectric crystal of BiFeO3. Results show that parallel walls on the opposite sides of a given domain within a simply twinned lamellar domain structure can have considerably different polarization and oxygen octahedra tilt profiles, different thickness and energy densities. The spontaneous formation of zigzag walls and triangular domains suggests that these domain walls are actually the lowest energy planar R180 walls in pure insulating BiFeO3 crystals and films.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.

Abstract: Composites of ferroelectric and paraelectric perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their application potential in energy storage as well as novel computing and memory devices. So far the main focus of research has been on superlattices and ferroelectric particles in a paraelectric matrix, while the impact of paraelectric inclusions on the ferroelectric matrix is surprisingly underrepresented. To close this gap in knowledge we perform molecular dynamics simulations using an $ab\ initio$ derived effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$--SrTiO$_3$ and reveal the dependency of phase stability and phase transitions on the size and distances of paraelectric inclusions. We discuss how the combination of compressive strain and depolarization fields at the SrTiO$_3$ interfaces induces large local polarization, complex domain structures and coexisting phases as well as diffuse phase transitions and reduced coercive fields.

Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.

Abstract: We present the thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth (tSW) model and apply it in the context of Molecular Dynamics simulations. The model is validated against an ensemble of immobilized, randomly oriented uniaxial particles (solid superparamagnet) and a classical dilute ferrofluid for different combinations of anisotropy strength and magnetic field/moment coupling, at a fixed temperature. We compare analytical and simulation results to quantify the viability of the tSW model in reproducing the equilibrium (with and without dipole-dipole interactions) and dynamic (without dipole-dipole interactions) properties of magnetic soft matter systems. We show that if the anisotropy of a particle is more than five times higher than the thermal fluctuations, tSW is applicable and efficient. This approach allows one to consider the interplay between N\'eel and Brownian relaxation, often neglected in the fixed point-dipole representation-based magnetic soft matter theoretical investigations.

Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.

Abstract: Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ single crystals at sub-Kelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR-spectra between 0 mT and 50 mT. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.

# Arbitrary control of the flow of light using pseudomagnetic fields in photonic crystals at telecommunication wavelengths

Abstract: In photonics, the idea of controlling light in a similar way that magnetic fields control electrons has always been attractive. It can be realized by synthesizing pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) in photonic crystals (PhCs). Previous works mainly focus on the Landau levels and the robust transport of the chiral states. More versatile control over light using complex nonuniform PMFs such as the flexible splitting and routing of light has been elusive, which hinders their application in practical photonic integrated circuits. Here we propose an universal and systematic methodology to design nonuniform PMFs and arbitrarily control the flow of light in silicon PhCs at telecommunication wavelengths. As proofs of concept, a low-loss S-bend and a highly efficient 50:50 power splitter based on PMFs are experimentally demonstrated. A high-speed data transmission experiment is performed on these devices to prove their applicability in real communication systems. The proposed method offers a new paradigm for the exploration of fundamental physics and the development of novel nanophotonic devices.

Abstract: We propose a photon-recycling dielectric laser accelerator (DLA) system based on silicon photonic device. Our DLA system employs guided electromagnetic waves as a primary energy source, modulated to inject into the electron-light interaction region to accelerate or modulate electron beams and recycled the energy for the next round-trip. Long-distance acceleration takes place as electrons interact with the pre-modulated light field. Our loop recycles post-interaction light field, enabling photons reuse across successive cycles. To optimize the interaction process, we developed an adaptive algorithm to refine waveguide structures, and identified an "optimal waveguide accelerator" with superior performance on our dataset. We find that the optimized DLA loop only requires low-power light injection to sufficiently sustain high acceleration gradients for continuous electron beams. Under optimal electron beam intensity, the system achieves exceptionally high photon utilization, ensuring that nearly all injected light power transferred to electrons. Using spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal waveguide also operates as an electron energy filter, selecting and manipulating phase-matched electrons over a broad energy range, even for quantum electron wavefunction shaping. Our photon-recycling DLA setup is not only suitable for low-energy beam accelerators, but also offers versatility as a beam filter or a narrow energy selection combined with other optical elements, the total setup can be further applied to explore free electron quantum optics engaging with the advancing field of photonic integrated circuits.

# Heat transport model for the transition between scaling regimes in quasistatic and full magnetoconvection

**Authors:** Matthew McCormack, Andrei Teimurazov, Olga Shishkina, Moritz Linkmann

arXiv:2501.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetoconvection, the flow is governed by the interplay between gravitational buoyancy and the Lorentz force, with one of these forces dominating in different regimes. In this paper, we develop a model with a single adjustable parameter that accurately captures the smooth transition from a buoyancy-dominated regime to one dominated by the Lorentz force. A perturbative extension of the model accounts for distinct transition features that occur at high Prandtl numbers. We validate the model for magnetoconvection in both the quasistatic regime and at finite magnetic Reynolds numbers using data from direct numerical simulations and existing experimental data sets. The model contains a natural extension to rotating convection and offers a potential generalisation to rotating magnetoconvection.

Abstract: Context. We use a global 3D hybrid plasma model to investigate the interaction between Mercury's magnetosphere and the solar wind for the second BepiColombo swingby, evaluate magnetospheric regions, and study the typical energy profile of protons. Aims. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of solar wind entry and analyze simulated plasma data along a trajectory using BepiColombo swingby 2 conditions, with the goal of enhancing our comprehension of measurement data and potentially providing forecasts for future swingbys. Methods. To model Mercury's plasma environment, we used the hybrid code AIKEF and developed a method to extract the particle (ion) data in order to compute the proton energy spectrum along the trajectory of BepiColombo during its second Mercury swingby on June 23, 2022. We evaluate magnetopause and bow shock stand-off distances under average upstream solar wind conditions with the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) condition derived from the BepiColombo magnetic field measurements during the second Mercury swingby. Results. We found that the magnetosheath on the quasi-perpendicular (dusk) side of the bow shock is thicker than that on the quasi-parallel (dawn) side, where a foreshock is formed. Multiple plasma populations can be extracted from our modeled energy spectra that assist in identifying magnetospheric regions. We observed protons of solar wind origin entering Mercury's magnetosphere. Their energies range from a few electron volts in the magnetosphere up to 10 keV in the magnetosheath.

Abstract: We present 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical for astrophysical black-hole jet-wind boundaries. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. We find that DKI can effectively disrupt the cats-eye vortices generated by KHI, creating a turbulent shear layer on the DK timescale. This interplay leads to a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe efficient nonthermal particle acceleration caused by the alignment of the instability-driven electric fields with Speiser-like motion of particles close to the shear interface. This study highlights the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple simultaneous instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.

Abstract: Different mechanisms of magnetization reversal in finite-length Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface have been investigated, taking into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It has been found that the magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through the simultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, the magnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by the formation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co and Fe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors have been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of these prefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significant and non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitatively describes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers and the frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from our theoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results of numerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimation of the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths, temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters. The proposed theoretical framework is applicable not only to the Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface but also to a broad class of one-dimensional magnetic systems.

Abstract: Recently-synthesised MoSi2N4 is the first septuple layer two-dimensional material, which doesn't naturally occurs as a layered crystal, and has been obtained with CVD growth. It can be considered as MoN2 crystal (with a crystal structure of MoS2) intercalating Si2N2 two-dimensional layer (with the structure similar to InSe). Such classification gave rise to the understanding of the electronic properties of the material, but also to the prediction of other members of the family (many dozens of them) as well as to the way to classify those. Whereas the originally-synthesised MoSi2N4 is a semiconductor, some of the members of the family are also metallic and some even demonstrate magnetic properties. Interestingly, the room-temperature mobility predicted for such crystals can be as high few thousands cm^2/V*s (hole mobility typically higher than electron) with some record cases as high as 5*10^4 cm^22/V*s, making these materials strong contenders for future electronic applications. The major interest towards these materials is coming from the septuple layer structure, which allows multiple crystal phases, but also complex compositions, in particular those with broken mirror-reflection symmetry against the layer of metal atoms.

Abstract: Using CaWO$_4$ crystals as cryogenic calorimeters, the CRESST experiment searches for nuclear recoils caused by the scattering of potential Dark Matter particles. A reliable identification of a potential signal crucially depends on an accurate background model. In this work we introduce an improved normalisation method for CRESST's model of the electromagnetic backgrounds. Spectral templates, based on Geant4 simulations, are normalised via a Bayesian likelihood fit to experimental background data. Contrary to our previous work, no assumption of partial secular equilibrium is required, which results in a more robust and versatile applicability. Furthermore, considering the correlation between all background components allows us to explain 82.7% of the experimental background within [1 keV, 40 keV], an improvement of 18.6% compared to our previous method.

Abstract: Exhausting power from the hot fusion core to the plasma-facing components is one of the biggest challenges in fusion energy. The MAST Upgrade tokamak uniquely integrates strong containment of neutrals within the exhaust area (divertor) with extreme divertor shaping capability. By systematically altering the divertor shape, this study shows the strongest evidence to date that long-legged divertors with a high magnetic field gradient (total flux expansion) deliver key power exhaust benefits without adversely impacting the hot fusion core. These benefits are already achieved with relatively modest geometry adjustments that are more feasible to integrate in reactor designs. Benefits include reduced target heat loads and improved access to, and stability of, a neutral gas buffer that 'shields' the target and enhances power exhaust (detachment). Analysis and model comparisons shows these benefits are obtained by combining multiple shaping aspects: long-legged divertors have expanded plasma-neutral interaction volume that drive reductions in particle and power loads, while total flux expansion enhances detachment access and stability. Containing the neutrals in the exhaust area with physical structures further augments these shaping benefits. These results demonstrate strategic variation in the divertor geometry and magnetic topology is a potential solution to one of fusion's biggest challenges: power exhaust.

Abstract: We present the thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth (tSW) model and apply it in the context of Molecular Dynamics simulations. The model is validated against an ensemble of immobilized, randomly oriented uniaxial particles (solid superparamagnet) and a classical dilute ferrofluid for different combinations of anisotropy strength and magnetic field/moment coupling, at a fixed temperature. We compare analytical and simulation results to quantify the viability of the tSW model in reproducing the equilibrium (with and without dipole-dipole interactions) and dynamic (without dipole-dipole interactions) properties of magnetic soft matter systems. We show that if the anisotropy of a particle is more than five times higher than the thermal fluctuations, tSW is applicable and efficient. This approach allows one to consider the interplay between N\'eel and Brownian relaxation, often neglected in the fixed point-dipole representation-based magnetic soft matter theoretical investigations.

Abstract: In this work we propose a method for probing the chirality of nanoscale electromagnetic near fields utilizing the properties of a coherent superposition of free-electron vortex states in electron microscopes. Electron beams optically modulated into vortices carry orbital angular momentum, thanks to which they are sensitive to the spatial phase distribution and topology of the investigated field. The sense of chirality of the studied specimen can be extracted from the spectra of the electron beam with nanoscale precision owing to the short picometer de Broglie wavelength of the electron beam. We present a detailed case study of the interaction of a coherent superposition of electron vortex states and the optical near field of a golden nanosphere illuminated by circularly polarized light as an example, and we examine the chirality sensitivity of electron vortex beams on intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanoantennae.

Abstract: Gyrokinetic simulations are utilized to study effects of magnetic islands on the ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence in the KSTAR tokamak with resonant magnetic perturbations. Simulations show that the transport is controlled by the nonlinear interactions between the ITG turbulence and self-generated vortex flows and zonal flows, leading to an anisotropic structure of fluctuation and transport on the poloidal plane and in the toroidal direction. Magnetic islands greatly enhance turbulent transport of both particle and heat. The turbulent transport exhibits variations in the toroidal direction, with transport through the resonant layer near the island X-point being enhanced when the X-point is located at the outer mid-plane. A quantitative agreement is shown between simulations and KSTAR experiments in terms of time frequency and perpendicular wavevector spectrum.

Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.

**Authors:** Adam, Slabon

Transitioning from crude oil to renewable carbon sources is crucial for a circular economy. Lignin, a byproduct of the paper industry, has significant potential as a renewable feedstock, but its efficient depolymerization remains challenging. This study presents an iron dual-atom catalyst (DAC) supported on biochar derived from spent coffee grounds for the selective electrochemical depolymerization of kraft lignin under ambient conditions. The catalyst was synthesized via pyrolysis and characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and X-ray pho-toelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These techniques confirmed the DAC’s atomic dispersion and chemical composition. The DAC’s in-operando stability was confirmed through XAS under varying electrochemical potentials. In a water/sodium carbonate electrolyte, the DAC achieved lignin depolymerization within 20 h. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses identified aliphatic products such as sodium acetate and formate, alongside phenolic monomers and dimers. This work demonstrates the potential of DACs for the valorization of biomass while establishing a framework for the monitoring of catalyst behavior at an atomic level during electrochemical biomass depolymerization, thus contributing to the development of advanced catalytic processes

# Rapid Acquisition of 103Rh Solid-State NMR Spectra by 31P Detection and Sideband Selective Methods

**Authors:** Wenyu , Huang

103Rh solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is potentially a powerful method for investigating the molecular and electronic structure of rhodium compounds. However, 103Rh is a difficult nucleus to study by NMR spectroscopy because of its small gyromagnetic ratio, broad chemical shift range, and long spin-lattice relaxation times (T1). While there are many prior reports demonstrating acquisition of 103Rh solution NMR spectra, there are few reports establishing a facile method with high sensitivity for acquiring 103Rh solid-state NMR spectra. Here, we utilize the large 31P-103Rh J-couplings (80-200 Hz) to efficiently acquire 31P-detected high-resolution 103Rh SSNMR spectra. We use sideband selective SSNMR techniques originally developed for wideline 195Pt SSNMR experiments. Notably, using these methods, we were able to acquire MAS 103Rh SSNMR spectra in experiment times on the order of 30 minutes to a few hours and from only a few mg of materials. The sideband selective experiments offer significant time savings as compared to existing direct detection methods, which require days of acquisition to obtain a directly detected MAS spectrum, or only yield low-resolution static powder patterns.  Numerical fits of the spectra provide chemical shift tensor parameters, with the experimental spectra agreeing well with the DFT-calculated spectra.

**Authors:** Matthew A, Conger

The ferryl heme forms of Staphylococcus aureus IsdG and IsdI have novel UV/Vis absorption spectra that are distinct from those of the three forms of ferryl heme typically found in biological systems: compound I, compound II, and com-pound ES. In this work, the ferryl heme form of IsdG was characterized because it is an analogue for the immediate product of enzyme-catalyzed heme hydroxylation. The ferryl heme form of IsdG generated following the addition of meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to the ferric heme form of IsdG has a half-life of 4.0 ± 0.2 min, which is more than 100 times longer than the half-life for the ferryl heme form of human heme oxygenase (hHO). Magnetic circular dichroism characterization of the IsdG species yielded spectral data and zero-field splitting parameters consistent with either a compound II- or compound ES-like ferryl heme. Further characterization of isotopically-enriched samples with elec-tron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the presence of a protein-based organic radical, as would be ex-pected for compound ES. Finally, multi-scale quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics and time-dependent density functional theory strongly suggest that the ferryl heme form of IsdG has a ruffled porphyrin ligand and an oxo ligand. Thus, the ferryl heme form of IsdG is assigned to a compound ES-like species with a Trp67-based radical. Electron transfer from Trp67 to porphyrin will stabilize the immediate product of heme hydroxylation and provide a thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. Furthermore, the ability to transfer an electron between Trp67 and the substrate may explain the differential reactivity of meso-hydroxyheme in IsdG and hHO.

Current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods often fail to differentiate bacterial infections from nonbacterial inflammatory conditions because of their poor specificity. To address this limitation, we synthesized two MRI probes that exploit bacterial-specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters for the selective delivery of manganese porphyrin-based nanoparticles into antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These probes were synthesized via click chemistry by coupling azide-functionalized maltotriose with alkyne-modified manganese hematoporphyrin, which formed self-assembling nanoparticles. Our studies revealed&amp;thinsp;~&amp;thinsp;65% probe uptake in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with negligible uptake (~&amp;thinsp;1%) in ABC transporter-deficient mutants. The probes demonstrated high longitudinal and transverse relaxivities (up to 11.56 mM⁻&amp;sup1;s⁻&amp;sup1; and 102.0 mM⁻&amp;sup1;s⁻&amp;sup1;, respectively), enabling ultrasensitive MRI detection of human-derived methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli at concentrations as low as 10⁶ CFU. In murine models, the probes differentiated bacterial nephritis from nonbacterial inflammation and visualized bacteria within tumour tissues, outperforming clinically used gadolinium-based agents. This study provides a promising approach for precise magnetic resonance imaging of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in deep tissues.

# Methods for randomized, blinded, controlled evaluation of putative disease interventions in multi-laboratory, preclinical assessment networks

## 在多实验室，临床前评估网络中对假定疾病干预措施进行随机，盲法，对照评估的方法

Science faces a reproducibility crisis, and public trust in science suffers when large clinical trials&mdash;qualified by promising preclinical studies&mdash;fail. While some clinical trial designs may have been inadequate, preclinical assessments of disease interventions have lacked key elements of rigor: treatment concealment, randomization, blinded outcomes, pre-specified and adequate sample sizes, and models including co-morbidities. To demonstrate feasibility and practicality of enhanced rigor in preclinical assessment, a six-laboratory network was designed that implemented rigorous study elements, using acute ischemic stroke for demonstration. This network enrolled 2615 animals in five different models and implemented a multi-stage, multi-arm statistical design that sequentially eliminated candidate interventions during interim analyses. The methods included centralized intervention packaging, randomization, data quality assessment, and data archiving. Blinded analysis of 9,274 video-recorded behavior tasks and 3,652 magnetic resonance images were evaluated. All tools and protocols are presented and could be adapted to preclinical assessment in other disease areas.

# A three-dimensional histological cell atlas of the developing human brain

## 发育中的人脑的三维组织学细胞图谱

The human brain is believed to contain a full complement of neurons by the time of birth together with a substantial amount of the connectivity architecture, even though a significant amount of growth occurs postnatally. The developmental process leading to this outcome is not well understood in humans in comparison with model organisms. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies give three-dimensional coverage but not cellular resolution. In contrast, sparsely sampled histological or spatial omics analyses have provided cellular resolution but not dense whole brain coverage.  To address the unmet need to provide a quantitative spatiotemporal map of developing human brain at cellular resolution, we leveraged tape-transfer assisted serial section histology to obtain contiguous histological series and unbiased imaging with dense coverage. Interleaved 20&mu; thick Nissl and H&amp;E series and MRI volumes are co-registered into multimodal reference volumes with 60&mu; isotropic resolution, together with atlas annotations and a stereotactic coordinate system based on skull landmarks. The histological atlas volumes have significantly more contrast and texture than the MRI volumes. We computationally detect cells brain-wide  to obtain quantitative characterization of the cytoarchitecture of the developing brain at 13-14 and 20-21 gestational weeks, providing the first comprehensive regional cell counts and characterizing the differential growth of the different brain compartments. Morphological characteristics permit segmentation of cell types from histology. We detected and quantified brain-wide distribution of mitotic figures representing dividing cells, providing an unprecedented spatiotemporal atlas of proliferative dynamics in the developing human brain. Further, we characterized the abundance and distribution of Cajal-Retzius cells, a transient cell population that plays essential roles in organizing glutamatergic cortical neurons into layers. Together, our study provides an unprecedented quantitative window into the developing human brain and the reference volumes and coordinate space should be useful for integrating spatial omics data sets with dense histological context.

# Downscaling the 100 kW SX-3 AF-MPD to the 5 kW SUPREME Thruster

## 将100 kW SX-3 af-mpd缩小到5 kW最高推进器

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5738053/latest

The SUPREME (Superconductor-Based Readiness Enhanced Magnetoplasmadynamic Electric Propulsion) thruster, in development by Neutron Star Systems DE GmbH (NSS) in collaboration with the Institute of Space Systems (IRS), University of Stuttgart, is designed for a nominal power level of 5 kW to have a wide range of commercial applications. Basis for the design is the SX3 thruster developed at IRS which is an engineering model operated between 2 and 100 kW with magnetic fields up to 400 mT. Both magnetic coil for the applied field and thruster anode are made of copper and are water-cooled. SUPREME will have a radiation cooled anode and a high temperature superconducting coil aiming at nominal maximal magnetic fields of 1.2 T. In the absence of a numerical simulation code for the plasma inside the thruster, the downscaling process described here relies on maintaining critical plasma parameters of the SX3 thruster to produce similar thruster performance with the smaller SUPREME. The downscaling to obtain a discharge unit geometry and the design process for the superconducting coil are described in detail, the SUPREME performance is estimated with a scaling code developed at IRS, and potential mission scenarios are investigated.

# The ups and downs of brain stress: Extending the triple network hypothesis

## 大脑压力的起伏: 扩展三重网络假说

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5675195/latest

Background: This pre-registered functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed to test and possibly extend the triple network hypothesis of psychosocial stress processing, positing that responses in the salience (SN) and default mode network (DMN) dominate at the expense of the central executive network (CEN).&amp;nbsp;
Methods: We reviewed psychosocial stress studies and conducted a mega-analysis of N=459 ScanSTRESS-datasets (222 women) with harmonized preprocessing (ENIGMA HALFpipe).&amp;nbsp;
Results: Our findings disconfirmed the original hypothesis, revealing activations and deactivations across all three networks, related in a complex way to hormonal, cardiac, subjective, and performance parameters. Additionally, we replicated an exposure-time effect of decreasing activation, identified a novel age effect of increasing DMN-activation, sex-specific patterns, and confirmed the involvement of all networks by task-based connectivity.&amp;nbsp;
Conclusions: These results suggest a new, extended triple network hypothesis of psychosocial stress processing, describing that SN- and DMN-structures orchestrate hormonal, cardiac, and subjective stress responses, while CEN- and DMN-structures process the stress-eliciting tasks.

# Generation of cross-polarized light and the effect of magnetic moments on plasmonic metasurfaces

## 交叉偏振光的产生和磁矩对等离子体超表面的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5734366/latest

There have been many reports on the generation of cross-polarized light in the infrared-to-radio-wave regions, but few reports on the generation of cross-polarized light in the visible region because this would require fabricating metasurfaces that consist of structures smaller than the wavelength in the visible region. In this study, we aimed to realize a circular polarization conversion element using a reflective plasmonic metasurface that generates cross-polarized light across a wide band of short visible wavelengths. To achieve this, we designed an aluminum (Al)-based reflective plasmonic metasurface and investigated a cross-polarization conversion mechanism by analyzing the role of the magnetic moment in the electromagnetic field distribution. The metasurface, which is composed of Al rectangular structures, demonstrated a reflectance of 62% for circularly cross-polarized light within the range of 450&amp;ndash;600 nm on the visible spectrum, and co-polarized light was notably absent in this wavelength region. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the magnetic moment in the generation of cross-polarized light. Specifically, a magnetic moment is induced on the surface of the Al rectangular structures, where the electric field is concentrated at the ends of their longer sides. This concentration extends the distance over which the current flowing through the rectangle is propagated, thereby enhancing the magnetic moment generated along the shorter sides. As a result, a significant phase delay is introduced, which enables an efficient cross-polarization conversion. In conclusion, we clarified the method and mechanism for generating cross-polarized light over a wide band in the short visible wavelengths of light.
