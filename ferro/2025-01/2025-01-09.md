Ferroelectrics are special materials with polarized positive and negative charges—like a magnet has north and south poles—that can be reversed when external electricity is applied. The materials will remain in these reversed states until more power is applied, making them useful for data storage and wireless communication applications.

Abstract: Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 4~GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.

# Field-Induced Ordered Phases in Anisotropic Spin-1/2 Kitaev Chains

## 各向异性自旋1/2 Kitaev链中的场诱导有序相

**Authors:** Mandev Bhullar, Haoting Xu, Hae-Young Kee

arXiv:2501.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by intense research on two-dimensional spin-1/2 Kitaev materials, Kitaev spin chains and ladders, though geometrically limited, have been studied for their numerical simplicity and insights into extended Kitaev models. The phase diagrams under the magnetic field were also explored for these quasi-one dimensional models. For an isotropic Kitaev chain, it was found that a magnetic field polarizes the ground state except along the symmetric field angle, where the chain is found to remain gapless up to a critical field strength where it enters an intriguing soliton phase before reaching the polarized state at higher field strengths. Here we study an anisotropic Kitaev chain under a magnetic field using the density matrix renormalization group technique, where the ground state has a macroscopic degeneracy with a finite gap in the absence of the magnetic field. When the field is mainly aligned parallel to the strong bond, four-site and large unit-cell ordered phases arise. In a certain angle of the field, another ordered phase characterized by a uniform chirality with six-site periodicity emerges. We employ a perturbation theory to understand such field-induced ordered phases. The effective model uncovers the presence of transverse Ising and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between unit cells, as well as further-neighbor Ising interaction induced by the magnetic field, which collectively explain the mechanisms behind these ordered states. Open questions and challenges are also discussed.

**Authors:** Sukla Pal, Stephen Powell

arXiv:2501.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamic scaling theory to describe relaxation dynamics following a magnetic-field quench near an unconventional phase transition in the magnetic material spin ice. Starting from a microscopic model, we derive an effective description for the critical dynamics in terms of the seeding and growth of string excitations, and use this to find scaling forms in terms of time, reduced temperature and monopole fugacity. We confirm the predictions of scaling theory using Monte Carlo simulations, which also show good quantitative agreement with analytical expressions valid in the limit of low monopole density. As well as being relevant for experiments in the spin ice materials, our results open the way for the study of dynamic critical properties in a family of unconventional classical phase transitions.

# Characterization of Flux Trapping in and Fabrication of Large-Scale Superconductor Circuits Using AC-Biased Shift Registers With 108500 Josephson Junctions

arXiv:2501.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of superconductor integrated circuits comprising six ac-powered SFQ shift registers with a total of 27078 bits and 108500 Josephson junctions (JJs) per 5 mm x 5 mm chip have been designed, fabricated, and tested to characterize flux trapping, fabrication process yield, and parameter spread. The six 4513-bit registers in the circuits have a common single-phase ac clock and individual input/output drivers enabling their parallel testing. We have investigated flux trapping in the circuits with various geometry, size, and distance between moats in two active ground planes (GPs), and containing up to three additional 'dummy' GPs, using multiple cooldowns through the critical temperature with various cooling rates and residual magnetic fields up to ~1.2 $\mu$T. For the slit-type and square moats arrayed along the sides of the register cells, we have found a negligible effect of flux sequestered in the moats on the operating margins of the registers, and negligible probability of detrimental flux trapping outside of the moats. Circuits with 0.3-$\mu$m-wide slit moats occupying <2% of the circuit area were fully operational in 100% of cooldowns, supporting the viability of VLSI superconductor digital circuits. We have found a strong enhancement of flux trapping outside of the moats in circuits with closely spaced GPs and determined a critical distance, t$_c$=0.6 $\mu$m, between them. The presence of GPs spaced below t$_c$ rendered the circuits nonoperational in 100% of cooldowns. We have measured 30 chips with >3M JJs and determined individual cell margins in 138 registers to characterize the fabrication-related parameter spread and detect fabrication defects and flux-trapping events. By finding outlier cells in the statistical distribution of the individual cell margins, we detected about one defect per million JJs, in most cases causing magnetic flux trapping in the affected cell.

Abstract: We expand here our description of a newly developed simple and effective ab initio method of calculating crystal field coefficients (CFCs) of rare-earth atoms in insulating hosts, focusing on Er in wide band gap oxide hosts MgO, ZnO, TiO$_2$, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$, which exemplify different local site symmetries. These hybrid functional calculations, which incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree-Fock theory, reproduce the experimentally identified insulating band gaps of these oxides. The negative values of cohesive and formation energies confirm the structural and chemical stability of these oxides, whereas the defect formation energies indicate that Er doped ZnO, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$ are easier to form compared to Er doped MgO and TiO$_2$. Er doped in these oxide hosts exhibits a spin magnetic moment of $\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$ confirming the $3+$ valence state. The CFCs of these hosted Er are determined from charge densities and potentials obtained from non-spin-polarized calculations, involving a 4\textit{f} core approximation. These CFCs are subsequently used to solve an effective Hamiltonian and generate the crystal field splitting of Er 4f. These calculated Er 4f energy levels are in good agreement with available experiments.

Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.

# Transitions from Composite Fermi Liquid to Moore-Read States in Weyl Semimetals

Abstract: Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.

Abstract: Magnetic frustrations and degeneracies profoundly affect ground-state magnetic properties emerging from competing exchange interactions. Controlling such frustrations using orbital and phonon engineering via the Kugel-Khomskii-type (KK-type) interactions has recently enabled the orbital enhancement of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling. Using combined spectroscopic techniques and first-principle simulations, here we demonstrate that the magnetically frustrated Cairo lattice, Bi2Fe4O9, exhibits a strong KK-type interaction resulting in a coupled spin-orbital phase below 1.8 times the Neel temperature (TN = 245 K). We observe an order of magnitude change in phonon linewidths that is not explainable considering spin-phonon coupling channels alone. Instead, the observed change is reminiscent of orbitally active materials, which we explicitly confirm by measuring the T-dependence of low-energy orbital excitations. We further find that Bi2Fe4O9 harbors an unstable polar mode, driving the lattice to a symmetry-lowered ferroelectric (FE) phase below TN, in line with the previously reported hysteresis in polarization. Nonetheless, the FE phase leads to extremely small calculated superlattice Bragg peak intensities that are yet to be experimentally confirmed. Moreover, thermal conductivity measurements do not show any measurable effect of KK-type interactions on thermal transport across TN. But, we observe a repeatable anomaly near 57 K appearing only in the heating cycle, which co-occurs with the 400 meV broad continuum observed in Raman measurements. The observed KK-type interaction in Bi2Fe4O9 provides an opportunity for orbital enhancement of ME coupling by phonon control of superexchange interactions.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions are topological spin structures with fully compensated, net-zero magnetization. Compared to their ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion counterparts, their reduced stray field and enhanced electrical response can enable linear, high-throughput current-driven motion. However, their bubble-like character in conventional bilayer AFs limits their stability to fluctuations, leading to deformation and annihilation. Here we present the engineering of a composite AF chiral multilayer, wherein the interplay of AF and FM interlayer couplings generates compensated skyrmions with compact structures. High-resolution magnetic imaging and micromagnetic simulations show that the internal exchange field stabilizes AF skyrmions at zero external field with characteristics comparable to FM counterparts at 100 mT. Quantitative analyses establish their decoupling above the exchange field, yielding independent, spatially segregated textures in constituent chiral layers. This work provides a foundation to develop AF spin-textures with enhanced immunity, compatible with efficient readout and manipulation, with relevance to unconventional computing.

Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems provides a powerful method to probe the underlying electronic properties by measuring tunneling conductance. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena.

Abstract: The ytterbium-based delafossite NaYbSe$_2$ is discussed as a prototype for a spin-orbit entangled, effective spin-1/2 triangular spin lattice with emerging antiferromagnetic correlations and a quantum-spin-liquid (QSL) ground state. We report on a comprehensive study of the static and dynamic anisotropic magnetism in single-crystalline samples of NaYbSe$_2$, using NMR spectroscopy as a local-probe technique. We performed $^{23}$Na and $^{77}$Se NMR measurements in magnetic fields up to 16 T, applied along the in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic directions and at temperatures from 300 down to 0.3 K. We could determine the anisotropic hyperfine contributions from the angular dependence of the $^{23}$Na and $^{77}$Se NMR spectra. In the paramagnetic regime, we probed the temperature dependence of the $^{23}$Na and $^{77}$Se spectral shift and the hyperfine coupling constants for fields applied along the principal crystal axes. The spin-lattice relaxation-rate data indicate critical spin fluctuations and the absence of long-range magnetic order at low magnetic fields and temperatures down to 0.3 K, evidenced by a monotonic increase of $1/T_1$ and associated spectral broadening. This is a clear proof of the evolution of a critical QSL ground state with residual fluctuations down to lowest temperatures. At elevated fields, we observe the emergence of long-range order, as the temperature-dependent $1/T_1$ rate passes through a pronounced maximum at $T_N$ at given field, followed by a decrease at lower temperatures. Further, we find an inhomogeneous broadening of the $^{23}$Na spectra below $T_N$, probing the histogram of the local-field distribution in the presence of the field-induced order.

Abstract: Pressure is a powerful thermodynamic parameter for tuning the magnetic properties of van der Waals magnets owing to their weak interlayer bonding. However, local magnetometry measurements under high pressure still remain elusive for this important class of emerging materials. Here we introduce a method enabling in situ magnetic imaging of van der Waals magnets under high pressure with sub-micron spatial resolution. Our approach relies on a quantum sensing platform based on boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which can be placed in atomic contact of any type of two-dimensional (2D) material within a van der Waals heterostructure. We first show that the V$_\text{B}^-$ center can be used as a magnetic field sensor up to pressures of a few GPa, a pressure range for which the properties of a wide variety of van der Waals magnets are efficiently altered. We then use V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in a thin hBN layer to perform magnetic imaging of a van der Waals magnet under pressure. As a proof of concept, we study the pressure-dependent magnetization in micrometer-sized flakes of $1T$-CrTe$_2$, whose evolution is explained by a shift of the Curie temperature. Besides providing a new path for studying pressure-induced phase transitions in van der Waals magnets, this work also opens up interesting perspectives for exploring the physics of 2D superconductors under pressure via local measurements of the Meissner effect.

Abstract: Topology is fundamental to condensed matter physics, underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in its various forms, protected surface states and spin-valley locking. Central to this is the Berry curvature, a measure of the geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions in crystals. Despite its established connections to space inversion and time-reversal symmetries, a comprehensive framework linking the Berry curvature to other crystal symmetries is still missing. Here, we present a theoretical model for the Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature in the proximity of optical resonances for all non-magnetic crystal classes. The Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature is readily derived from the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of the time-invariant point groups. We show that the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix, which define the divergence of the Berry curvature, are non-zero only for the chiral crystal classes, pointing towards a topological origin of circular dichroism. In polar crystals, we uniquely find a non-zero curl of the Berry curvature, suggesting a topological origin of spontaneous polarization via the Maxwell-Berry equations. Our findings thus open new perspectives for the topological interpretation of textbook phenomena at the heart of condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Spin-orbit torque-induced perpendicular magnetization switching has attracted much attention due to the advantages of nonvolatility, high density, infinite read/write counts, and low power consumption in spintronic applications. To achieve field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization, additional magnetic field, magnetic layer assistance, or artificially designed structural symmetry breaking are usually required, which are not conducive to the high-density integration and application of low-power devices. However, 2D Weyl semimetals with low-symmetry structures have recently been found to generate z-spin-polarized currents, which may induce out-of-plane damping-like torques to their neighboring ferromagnetic layers, and realize deterministic perpendicular magnetization switching at zero magnetic field. In this Letter, we report that current-induced field-free magnetization switching at room temperature can be achieved in a perpendicularly magnetized TaIrTe4/Pt/Co/Pt device, and the critical switching current density can be lowered to be about 2.64*105 Acm-2. This study suggests that TaIrTe4 has great potential for the design of room-temperature efficient spintronic devices.

Abstract: The metallic delafossites host ultra-high mobility carriers in the bulk, while at their polar surfaces, intrinsic electronic reconstructions stabilise markedly distinct electronic phases, from charge-disproportionated insulators, to Rashba-split heavy-hole gases and ferromagnetic metals. The understanding of these phases has been strongly informed by surface spectroscopic measurements, but previous studies have been complicated by the presence of spatially varying terminations of the material surface. Here, we demonstrate the potential of microscopic-area angle-resolved photoemission to overcome these challenges. Our measurements of the model compound PdCoO$_2$ yield extremely high-quality spectra of the electronic structure, which allows us to place new experimental constraints on the weak electron-phonon coupling in the bulk of PdCoO$_2$, while revealing much stronger interactions at its surfaces. While the CoO$_2$-terminated surface exhibits a conventional weak-coupling behavior, our measurements reveal surprising spectroscopic signatures of polaron formation at the Pd-terminated surface, despite its pronounced metallicity. Together, our findings reveal how mode and symmetry-selective couplings can markedly tune the electron-phonon interactions in a single host material, here opening routes to stabilise surprisingly persistent polaronic quasiparticles.

Abstract: Superconductors exhibit dissipationless supercurrents even under finite bias and magnetic field conditions, provided these remain below the critical values. However, type-II superconductors in the flux flow regime display Ohmic dissipation arising from vortex dynamics under finite magnetic fields. The interplay between supercurrent and Ohmic dissipation in a type-II superconductor is dictated by vortex motion and the robustness of vortex pinning forces. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of the superconducting phase transitions and vortex dynamics in the atomically thin type-II superconductor 2H-NbSe$_2$. We fabricated a high-quality multilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$ with a step junction, demonstrating supercurrent in clean limit below a critical temperature of 6.6 K and a high residual resistance ratio of 17. The upper critical field was estimated to be 4.5 T and the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length 8.6 nm. Additionally, we observed phase transitions induced by vortex viscous dynamics in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ step junction. Analysis of the pinning force density using the Dew-Hughes model indicates that the pinning force in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ device can be attributed to step junction, related to the surface-$\Delta\kappa$ type of pinning centers. Our findings pave the way for engineering pinning forces by introducing artificial pinning centers through partial atomic thickness variation in layered 2D superconductors while minimizing unwanted quality degradation in the system.

Abstract: The topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits two types of surface Dirac cones: one located at non-time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (001) and (110) surfaces, and the other at time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (111) surface. Motivated by the recent experimental evidence of Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) and their hybridization on the (001) surface [Nature 633, 71 (2024)], we present a comprehensive investigation of Majorana vortex phases in SnTe, including topological classification, surface-state Hamiltonians analysis, and lattice model calculations. By utilizing rotational and magnetic mirror symmetries, we present two equivalent methods to reveal the topology of Majorana phases on different surfaces. We find that the MVEMs on the (001) and (110) surfaces are protected by both magnetic group and rotational symmetries. In contrast, the MVEMs on the (111) surface are protected by magnetic group or particle-hole symmetry. Due to the different properties of Dirac fermions in the $\bar{\Gamma}$ and $\bar{M}$ valleys on the (111) surfaces, including Fermi velocities and energy levels, we find that abundant vortex phase transitions can occur for the [111]-direction vortex. As the chemical potential increases, the number of robust MVEMs can change from $0\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2$. These vortex transitions are characterized by both $Z$ winding number and $Z_2$ pfaffian topological invariants.

We make an expansion in $\alpha =J_{xy}/J_{zz}$ instead of $1/S$ and calculate the magnon dispersion for any value of the spin $S$ at second order in $\alpha$, with two important conclusions: (i) the 1/S expansion converges very slowly for S=1/2, making spin-wave theory quantitatively inaccurate up to very large orders; (ii) compared to the linear spin-wave predictions, our magnon dispersion presents a much better agreement with experimental results on K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, for which $\alpha \simeq 0.08$.

Abstract: Ion bombardment is currently an active area of research for patterning rare earth/transition metal ferrimagnetic thin films because the magnetic properties are extremely sensitive to changes in the constituent sublattices. It has previously been shown that ion bombardment can be used to deliberately reduce the contribution of the rare earth sublattice in rare earth/transition metal ferrimagnets by selective oxidation. However, the exact mechanism by which oxidation occurs remains an outstanding question. We show that the defects introduced by ion bombardment of Tb/Co multilayers using different ion species with projected range (i.e., 10 keV He + , 15 keV O + , and 30 keV Ga +) create easy diffusion paths for oxygen to penetrate the system. The choice of ion species and fluence enables the effective composition of the films to be tailored by reducing the amount of magnetically-active Tb.

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have promised the realisation of artificial materials with multiple physical phenomena such as giant optical nonlinearities, spin-to-charge interconversion in spintronics and topological carrier protection, in a single layered device through an infinitely diverse set of quantum materials. However, most efforts have only focused on exfoliated material that inherently limits both the dimensions of the materials and the scalability for applications. Here, we show the epitaxial growth of large area heterostructures of topological insulators (Bi2Se3), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, WSe2) and ferromagnets (Co), resulting in the combination of functionalities including tuneable optical nonlinearities, spin-to-charge conversion and magnetic proximity effects. This is demonstrated through coherent phase resolved terahertz currents, bringing novel functionalities beyond those achievable in simple homostructures. In particular, we show the role of different TMD polymorphs, with the simple change of one atomic monolayer of the artificial material stack entirely changing its optical, electrical and magnetic properties. This epitaxial integration of diverse two-dimensional materials offers foundational steps towards diverse perspectives in quantum material engineering, where the material polymorph can be controlled at technological relevant scales for coupling applications in, for example, van der Waals nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, spintronics, multiferroics and coherent current control.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnons on the $\alpha$-T$_3$ lattice. Atomistic spin dynamics simulations show that next-nearest neighbor hopping and easy-axis anisotropy stabilize ferromagnetic order in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We identify one topologically trivial magnon insulator phase and three magnon Chern insulator phases. The topologically trivial magnon insulator phase exhibits a small but non-zero magnon thermal Hall conductivity, while in the magnon Chern insulator phases the Chern number of the lowest magnon band dominates the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. The sign of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity does not change at the topological phase boundaries, but distinct changes are observed in the magnitude.

Abstract: In 2021 Nature Physics published a paper by Vaitiekenas, Liu, Krogstrup and Marcus titled "Zero-bias peaks at zero magnetic field in ferromagnetic hybrid nanowires". The paper reports low temperature transport measurements on semiconductor InAs nanowires with two partly overlapping shells -- a shell of EuS, a magnetic insulator, and a shell of Al, a metal that becomes superconducting at temperatures below 1.2K. The paper claims that (1) the data are consistent with induced topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs), and (2) that this is facilitated by the breaking of the time reversal symmetry through a direct magnetic interaction with the EuS shell. In this Matters Arising, we present an alternative explanation which is based on trivial effects that are likely to appear in the reported geometry. Specifically, first, we find that data the authors present in support of the topological superconductivity claim can originate from unintended quantum dots in their devices, a widely known likely explanation that is not being discussed in the paper. Second, our analysis of the setup, supported by our numerical micromagnetic simulations, shows similar effects could be obtained due to stray magnetic fields from the region of the EuS shell damaged during Al etching. This basic picture should come before the exotic interpretation in terms of magnetic exchange interaction with a ferromagnetic insulator.

Abstract: Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.

Abstract: Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolishing readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.

However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase transition temperature. We report that surprisingly an in-plane current can tune the magnetic state of nm-thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is the direct demonstration of the current-induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in-plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin-orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. And we further demonstrate a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of our discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current. Our findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impacts on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.

Abstract: Robust multi-level spin memory with the ability to write information electrically is a long-sought capability in spintronics, with great promise for applications. Here we achieve nonvolatile and highly energy-efficient magnetization switching in a single-material device formed of van-der-Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, whose magnetic information can be readily controlled by a tiny current. Furthermore, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 400 and 4000 times smaller than those of the existing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory based on conventional magnet/heavy-metal systems. Most importantly, we also demonstrate multi-level states, switched by electrical current, which can dramatically enhance the information capacity density and reduce computing costs. Thus, our observations combine both high energy efficiency and large information capacity density in one device, showcasing the potential applications of the emerging field of van-der-Waals magnets in the field of spin memory and spintronics.

Abstract: Unravelling the mechanism behind bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in amorphous rare earth-transition metal films has proven challenging. This is largely due to the inherent complexity of amorphous structure and the entangled potential origins arising from microstructure and atomic structure factors. Here, we present an approach wherein the magneto-electric effect is harnessed to induce 90{\deg} switching of bulk PMA in Tb-Co films to in-plane directions by applying voltages of only -1.2 V. This manipulation is achieved by voltage-driven insertion of hydrogen atoms into interstitial sites between Tb and Co atoms, which serves as a perturbation to local atomic structure. Using angle-dependent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we find that the anisotropy switching originates from the distortion of crystal field around Tb which reorients the alignment of Tb orbital moments. Initially aligned along Tb-Co bonding directions, the easy magnetization axis undergoes reorientation and switches by 90{\deg}, as substantiated by ab-initio calculations. Our study not only concludes the atomic origin of Tb-Co atom bonding configuration in shaping bulk PMA, but also establishes the groundwork for electrically programmable ferrimagnetic spintronics, such as controlling domain wall motion and programming artificial spin textures.

Abstract: Quantum geometric tensor (QGT), which is usually obtained by evaluating the quantum distance between Bloch states parametrized by momentum, plays a key role in exploring the exotic responses of quantum materials. Herein, we revisit the concept of QGT by further taking into account the spin degree of freedom. Besides the conventional QGT relating to momentum translation, we uncover a new QGT (termed Zeeman QGT) relating to momentum translation as well as spin rotation, whose imaginary (real) part gives the Zeeman Berry curvature (quantum metric). Notably, we show that these novel quantum geometric quantities can drive an intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in spin-orbit coupled materials when the electron spin is steered by an oscillating magnetic field. With symmetry analysis, we show that a wide range of materials can support the IGMC, as illustrated by model calculations. Finally, we discuss the experimental aspects of detecting the IGMC driven by Zeeman QGT.

Abstract: Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar metal states.

Abstract: In ferroelectric materials, an electric field has been shown to change the phonon dispersion sufficiently to alter the lattice thermal conductivity, opening the possibility that a heat gradient could drive a polarization flux, and technologically, also opening a pathway towards voltage-driven, all solid-state heat switching. In this report, we confirm the validity of the theory originally developed for Pb(Zr,Ti)O_3 (PZT) on the ferroelectric relaxor 0.67Pb[Mg_(1/3)Nb_(2/3)]O_3-0.33PbTiO_3 (PMN-33PT). In the theory, the change in sound velocity and thermal conductivity with electric field relates to the piezoelectric coefficients and the Gruneisen parameter. It predicts that in PMN-33PT the effect should be an order of magnitude larger, and of opposite sign as in PZT; this is confirmed here experimentally. The effects are measured on samples never poled before and on samples that underwent multiple field sweep cycles and passed through two phase transitions with change in temperature. The thermal conductivity changes are linked to variations in the piezoelectric coefficients and can be as large as 8-11% at room temperature and above. To date, this is the only means of heat conduction modulation that utilizes changes in the phonon spectrum. While this technology is in its infancy, it offers another path to future active thermal conduction control.

Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnets is paramount for electrically controlled spintronics due to their intrinsic potentials for higher memory density, scalability, thermal stability and endurance, surpassing an in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Nickel film is a long-lived fundamental element ferromagnet, yet its electrical transport behavior associated with magnetism has not been comprehensively studied, hindering corresponding spintronic applications exploiting nickel-based compounds. Here, we systematically investigate the highly versatile magnetism and corresponding transport behavior of nickel films. As the thickness reduces within the general thickness regime of a magnet layer for a memory device, the hardness of nickel films' ferromagnetic loop of anomalous Hall effect increases and then decreases, reflecting the magnetic transitions from IMA to PMA and back to IMA. Additionally, the square ferromagnetic loop changes from a hard to a soft one at rising temperatures, indicating a shift from PMA to IMA. Furthermore, we observe a butterfly magnetoresistance resulting from the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect, which evolves in conjunction with the thickness and temperature-dependent magnetic transformations as a complementary support. Our findings unveil the rich magnetic dynamics and most importantly settle down the most useful guiding information for current-driven spintronic applications based on nickel film: The hysteresis loop is squarest for the ~8 nm-thick nickel film, of highest hardness with Rxyr/Rxys~1 and minimum Hs-Hc, up to 125 K; otherwise, extra care should be taken for a different thickness or at a higher temperature.

Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.

Abstract: The intrinsic spin Hall effect (ISHE), as proposed in [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.126603} {Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{92}, 126603 (2004)}], stems from the spin Berry curvature. Herein, we propose the concept of \textit{spin quantum metric}, which is established as the quantum geometric counterpart of the spin Berry curvature within the \textit{spin quantum geometric tensor}, defined in a manner analogous to the conventional quantum geometric tensor. In contrast to the well-known $\mathcal{T}$-even ($\mathcal{T}$, time reversal) spin Berry curvature, the \textit{spin quantum metric} is a $\mathcal{T}$-odd tensor. Remarkably, by symmetry analysis we show that the $\mathcal{T}$-odd \textit{spin quantum metric} can also drive an ISHE particularly under a high-frequency electric field. We investigate this $\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE in the magnetically tilted surface Dirac cone and ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. We find that this $\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE dominates when the Fermi level is close to the band crossing or anticrossing point and can be as large as the $\mathcal{T}$-even ISHE when a THz or an infrared driving field is applied. Our work not only reveals an indispensable member in emergent quantum geometry physics but also offers a novel response function for ultrafast spintronics.

Abstract: Iron chalcogenides superconductors, such as Fe(Te,Se) have recently garnered significant attention due to their simple crystal structure with a relatively easy synthesis process, high-temperature superconductivity, intrinsic topological band structure, and an unconventional pairing of superconductivity with ferromagnetism. Here, we report the complex in-plane refractive index measurement of nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flake exfoliated from a single crystal FeTe$_{\text{0.6}}$Se$_{\text{0.4}}$ for photon wavelengths from 450 to 1100 nm over a temperature range from 4 K to 295 K. The results were obtained by employing a two-Drude model for the dielectric function of Fe(Te,Se), a multiband superconductor, and fitting the absolute optical reflection spectra using the transfer matrix method. A high extinction coefficient in the visible to near-infrared range makes nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flakes a promising material for photodetection applications.

Abstract: As the dielectric film thickness shrinks to ~10 nm, some traditional wurtzite piezoelectric materials demonstrate ferroelectricity through element doping. Among them, Sc doped AlN and Mg doped ZnO are the most famous examples. While it is widely acknowledged that the dopant atoms effectively reduce the coercive field, enabling ferroelectric polarization switching, the material genome of these wurtzite (WZ) ferroelectrics is still less understood. In this work, we analyze the features of WZ ferroelectrics, ascribing them to five-coordination (5C) ferroelectrics, which may be compared with 6C ferroelectrics (perovskite-type) and 7C ferroelectrics (hafnia-like). In particular, the exact reason for their adopting the hexagonal WZ structure instead of the zinc blende structure is studied. Emphasis is paid to the degree of ionicity in promoting the hexagonal arrangement, and the phenomenon of layer distance compression is discovered and explained in WZ ferroelectrics. The role of element doping in coercive field reduction is understood within this context.

Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.

Abstract: This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.

Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of a magnetic kagome metal EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which undergoes magnetic ordering below $T_\mathrm{c}=10.5$ K. Unlike typical magnets showing anomalous magnetotransport in their ordered states, EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ exhibits unusual magnetotransport behaviors in its paramagnetic phase. Specifically, the magnetoconductivity shows a linear dependence on magnetic field at low fields below $\sim 1$ T, and the Hall conductivity undergoes a sign change below about 2 T. These behaviors resemble those observed in the charge density wave (CDW) phase of kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs). The anomalous magnetotransport in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ has commonly been attributed to the possible emergence of a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral CDW order. However, given the absence of CDW in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and its manifestation exclusively in the paramagnetic state, the anomalous magnetotransport observed in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ is likely associated with multiband transport and/or the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.

Abstract: It is known that the electromagnetic vacuum is responsible for the Lamb shift, which is a crucial phenomenon in quantum electrodynamics (QED). In circuit QED, the readout or bus resonators that are dispersively coupled can result in a significant Lamb shift of the qubit. However, previous approaches or proposals for controlling the Lamb shift in circuit QED demand overheads in circuit designs or non-perturbative renormalization of the system's eigenbases, which can impose formidable limitations.In this work, we propose and demonstrate an all-microwave method for controlling the Lamb shift of fixed-frequency transmons. We employ the drive-induced longitudinal coupling between the transmon and resonator. By simply using an off-resonant monochromatic drive near the resonator frequency, we can control the net Lamb shift up to 30 MHz and engineer it to zero with the drive-induced longitudinal coupling without facing the aforementioned challenges. Our work establishes an efficient way of engineering the fundamental effects of the electromagnetic vacuum and provides greater flexibility in non-parametric frequency controls of multilevel systems.

arXiv:2307.12773v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L>4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture.
  Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.

Abstract: The vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons offers numerous possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. The development of twistoptics - the modulation of the optical properties by twisting stacks of vdW materials - enables directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, known as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of directional propagation of polaritons by reporting the visualization of unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). They arise naturally in twisted hyperbolic stacks with very different thicknesses of their constituents, demonstrated for homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Importantly, their ray-like propagation, characterized by large momenta and constant phase, is tunable by both the twist angle and the illumination frequency. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings introduce twisted asymmetric stacks as efficient platforms for nanoscale directional polariton propagation, opening the door for applications in nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.

Both pressures are in essence tensors, but a quasi-scalar theory is sufficient for the simple media.

Abstract: An improved understanding of Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) merging and stability in high acceleration and compression magnetic fields is needed to speed up the development of the pulsed fusion concept developed at Helion Energy. All previous theoretical and simulation work on FRC merging and compression was performed using 2D MHD models. The results of novel 2D hybrid simulations (fluid electrons and full-orbit kinetic ions) of FRC merging and compression are presented. Results of kinetic and MHD simulations, computed using the HYM code, are compared and analyzed. In cases without axial magnetic compression, both the MHD and hybrid simulations show a high sensitivity to the initial parameters (i.e. FRC separation, velocity, normalized separatrix radius, and plasma viscosity), showing that FRCs with large elongation and separatrix radius either do not merge or merge partially, forming a doublet FRC. Application of a mirror coil field at the FRC ends with increasing strength is shown to lead to fast and complete merging of the FRCs in MHD and kinetic simulations.

Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}<1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.

Abstract: On-demand polarization control of electromagnetic waves is the fundamental element of modern optics. Its interest has recently been expanded in the terahertz (THz) range for coherent excitation of collective quasiparticles in matters, triggering a wide variety of non-trivial intriguing physics, e.g., anharmonicity, nonlinear coupling, and metastability. Wavelength tunability in THz polarization control is fundamentally important for the resonant excitation of collective modes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a simple and convenient THz phase retarder based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer to obtain circular polarization. The efficiency of THz polarization conversion is demonstrated by the achieved high polarization degree of more than 99.9% and a large transmission of ~76%. The simple and compact setup allows us to adapt the phase retarder to existing setups readily and will contribute to further exploration of ultrafast science, e.g., chiral phononics.

The dependence of Ts on the minimum magnetic field of the configuration Bmin is corroborated, also observing that the ion extraction peak field Bext has no influence on temperature. Details on the mechanism generating the hot electron population responsible for the change in spectral x-ray temperature as a function of Bmin are proposed, based on an in-depth investigation of the electron population with the MC code using a high statistics.

Abstract: An unstable magnetron RF source for driving an accelerator cavity at high power is stabilized using ferroelectric fast reactive tuning. The magnetron output is converted to a selected reference frequency with negligible insertion loss. The conversion is achieved by modulating the magnetron's frequency, such that the modulation converts the magnetron's output to the exact reference frequency. The method also allows simultaneous amplitude and phase control.

Abstract: A variety of superconductor integrated circuits comprising six ac-powered SFQ shift registers with a total of 27078 bits and 108500 Josephson junctions (JJs) per 5 mm x 5 mm chip have been designed, fabricated, and tested to characterize flux trapping, fabrication process yield, and parameter spread. The six 4513-bit registers in the circuits have a common single-phase ac clock and individual input/output drivers enabling their parallel testing. We have investigated flux trapping in the circuits with various geometry, size, and distance between moats in two active ground planes (GPs), and containing up to three additional 'dummy' GPs, using multiple cooldowns through the critical temperature with various cooling rates and residual magnetic fields up to ~1.2 $\mu$T. For the slit-type and square moats arrayed along the sides of the register cells, we have found a negligible effect of flux sequestered in the moats on the operating margins of the registers, and negligible probability of detrimental flux trapping outside of the moats. Circuits with 0.3-$\mu$m-wide slit moats occupying <2% of the circuit area were fully operational in 100% of cooldowns, supporting the viability of VLSI superconductor digital circuits. We have found a strong enhancement of flux trapping outside of the moats in circuits with closely spaced GPs and determined a critical distance, t$_c$=0.6 $\mu$m, between them. The presence of GPs spaced below t$_c$ rendered the circuits nonoperational in 100% of cooldowns. We have measured 30 chips with >3M JJs and determined individual cell margins in 138 registers to characterize the fabrication-related parameter spread and detect fabrication defects and flux-trapping events. By finding outlier cells in the statistical distribution of the individual cell margins, we detected about one defect per million JJs, in most cases causing magnetic flux trapping in the affected cell.

Abstract: Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities which can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) under different frequency ratios ($\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We found that the beam-Langmuir (BL) and upper-hybrid (UH) modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of $\sim$$10^{-4} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$, while the harmonics (H) can extend to $\sim$$1.5 \times 10^{-5} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$ depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, beam, and ring-beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.

Abstract: Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.

# The signature of topology in polar and chiral non-magnetic crystal classes

Abstract: Topology is fundamental to condensed matter physics, underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in its various forms, protected surface states and spin-valley locking. Central to this is the Berry curvature, a measure of the geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions in crystals. Despite its established connections to space inversion and time-reversal symmetries, a comprehensive framework linking the Berry curvature to other crystal symmetries is still missing. Here, we present a theoretical model for the Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature in the proximity of optical resonances for all non-magnetic crystal classes. The Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature is readily derived from the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of the time-invariant point groups. We show that the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix, which define the divergence of the Berry curvature, are non-zero only for the chiral crystal classes, pointing towards a topological origin of circular dichroism. In polar crystals, we uniquely find a non-zero curl of the Berry curvature, suggesting a topological origin of spontaneous polarization via the Maxwell-Berry equations. Our findings thus open new perspectives for the topological interpretation of textbook phenomena at the heart of condensed matter physics.

Abstract: The vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons offers numerous possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. The development of twistoptics - the modulation of the optical properties by twisting stacks of vdW materials - enables directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, known as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of directional propagation of polaritons by reporting the visualization of unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). They arise naturally in twisted hyperbolic stacks with very different thicknesses of their constituents, demonstrated for homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Importantly, their ray-like propagation, characterized by large momenta and constant phase, is tunable by both the twist angle and the illumination frequency. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings introduce twisted asymmetric stacks as efficient platforms for nanoscale directional polariton propagation, opening the door for applications in nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.

Abstract: By the mechanical pressure we mean that the pressure in the fundamental thermodynamic equation with the naive form of the electromagnetic work used, while the thermodynamic one we mean that in the equation with proper thermodynamic form of the electromagnetic work instead. Both pressures differ from a magnetic mutual field pressure which results from the electromagnetic stress tensor for the linear and uniform media in static electromagnetic field. Both pressures are in essence tensors, but a quasi-scalar theory is sufficient for the simple media.

Abstract: The influence of the presence of cosmic fluid on the magnetosonic waves and modulation instabilities in the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is investigated. The fluid model is developed by modifying the pressure equation in such dissipative rotating magnetoplasmas incorporating thermal ionized gas and cosmic rays. Applying the normal mode analysis, a modified dispersion relation is derived to study linear magnetosonic wave modes and their instabilities. The cosmic rays influence the wave damping by accelerating the damping rate. The standard reductive perturbation method is employed in the fluid model leading to a Korteweg de Vries Burgers (KdVB) equation in the small-amplitude limit. Several nonlinear wave shapes are assessed by solving the KdVB equation, analytically and numerically. The cosmic ray diffusivity and magnetic resistivity are responsible for the generation of shock waves. The modulational instability (MI) and the rogue wave solutions of the magnetosonic waves are studied by deriving a nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation from the obtained KdVB equation under the assumption that the cosmic ray diffusion and magnetic resistivity are weak and the carrier wave frequency is considerably lower than the wave frequency. The influence of various plasma parameters on the growth rate of MI is examined. The modification of the pressure term due to cosmic fluid reduces the MI growth in the interstellar medium. In addition, a quantitative analysis of the characteristics of rogue wave solutions is presented. Our investigation's applicability to the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is traced out.

Abstract: Instead of computing magneticallly induced (MI) current densities (CD) via the wave function and their quatum mechanical definition one can also use the differential form of the Amp\`ere-Maxwell law to obtain them from spatial derivatives of the induced magnetic field. In magnetic molecular response calculations, the latter can be done by numerical derivativation of the so called ``nucleus-independent chemical shifts'' (NICS) which are avaialable to many standard quantum chemical programs. The resulting numerical MICD data is in contrast to other numerically obtained MICDs computed via the wave function route, virtually divergence-free.

Abstract: Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next-generation of energy-efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase transition temperature. We report that surprisingly an in-plane current can tune the magnetic state of nm-thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is the direct demonstration of the current-induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in-plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin-orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. And we further demonstrate a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of our discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current. Our findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impacts on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.

Abstract: Robust multi-level spin memory with the ability to write information electrically is a long-sought capability in spintronics, with great promise for applications. Here we achieve nonvolatile and highly energy-efficient magnetization switching in a single-material device formed of van-der-Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, whose magnetic information can be readily controlled by a tiny current. Furthermore, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 400 and 4000 times smaller than those of the existing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory based on conventional magnet/heavy-metal systems. Most importantly, we also demonstrate multi-level states, switched by electrical current, which can dramatically enhance the information capacity density and reduce computing costs. Thus, our observations combine both high energy efficiency and large information capacity density in one device, showcasing the potential applications of the emerging field of van-der-Waals magnets in the field of spin memory and spintronics.

Abstract: Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar metal states.

Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnets is paramount for electrically controlled spintronics due to their intrinsic potentials for higher memory density, scalability, thermal stability and endurance, surpassing an in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Nickel film is a long-lived fundamental element ferromagnet, yet its electrical transport behavior associated with magnetism has not been comprehensively studied, hindering corresponding spintronic applications exploiting nickel-based compounds. Here, we systematically investigate the highly versatile magnetism and corresponding transport behavior of nickel films. As the thickness reduces within the general thickness regime of a magnet layer for a memory device, the hardness of nickel films' ferromagnetic loop of anomalous Hall effect increases and then decreases, reflecting the magnetic transitions from IMA to PMA and back to IMA. Additionally, the square ferromagnetic loop changes from a hard to a soft one at rising temperatures, indicating a shift from PMA to IMA. Furthermore, we observe a butterfly magnetoresistance resulting from the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect, which evolves in conjunction with the thickness and temperature-dependent magnetic transformations as a complementary support. Our findings unveil the rich magnetic dynamics and most importantly settle down the most useful guiding information for current-driven spintronic applications based on nickel film: The hysteresis loop is squarest for the ~8 nm-thick nickel film, of highest hardness with Rxyr/Rxys~1 and minimum Hs-Hc, up to 125 K; otherwise, extra care should be taken for a different thickness or at a higher temperature.

Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.

Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.

**Authors:** Timothy, Swager

The connection between magnetic field induced optical activity and chirality has a rich and complicated history. Although the broken inversion symmetry of chiral molecules generates ‘natural’ optical activity, magnetic optical activity is generated by breaking of time reversal symmetry. As a result, molecular chirality is not expected to influence magnetic optical phenomena, such as Faraday rotation. Here we show that the chiral supramolecular assembly of polymers can result in a large Faraday effect. This strong Faraday rotation, which is amongst the highest value known for organic materials, originates from the so-called Faraday B term. Typically, B term Faraday responses are weak. We demonstrate large amplification through excitonic coupling within the supramolecular assembly, where the chirality of the system controls the assembly formed. These observations provide an alternative means to enhance the Faraday rotation of low symmetry systems and clarify the role of chirality in previous reported materials. Tuneable magneto-optical phenomena in low-cost organic materials opens the door to applications including safety testing, bioimaging and quantum information processing

**Authors:** Gemma C., Solomon

When a small electric bias is applied to a single- molecule junction, current will flow through the molecule via a tunneling mechanism. In molecules with a cyclic or helical structure there may be circular currents, giving rise to a uni-directional magnetic field. Here, we implement the Biot-Savart law and calculate the magnetic field resulting from the ballistic current density for a selection of molecules. We find that three prerequisites are important for achieving a substantial magnetic field in a single-molecule junction. (1) The current must be high, (2) the ring current must be unidirectional within the bias window, and (3) the diameter of the ring current must be small. We identify both cyclic and linear molecules that potentially fulfill these requirements. In cyclic annulenes with bond-length alternation the current might induce a magnetic field in the mT-range whereas archetypical cyclic molecules, such as benzene, are not suitable candidates for the generation of a substantial magnetic field. Finally, we show that in linear carbon chains with circular current due to their helical π-orbital system, the magnetic field can potentially reach the tesla-range. Our results prove that a large magnetic field can, at least in theory, be induced in molecular wires even at low bias.

**Authors:** Sharon, Mitchell

Single atom catalysts (SACs) have revolutionized the field of catalysis achieving an unprecedented level of control and metal utilization for solid materials, approaching what is expected with molecular catalysts.1-3 Establishing structure-activity relationships for their wide-ranging applications requires precise elucidation of the metal coordination environment, which remains a grand challenge.1,2 While electron microscopy reveals atomic dispersion, only average coordination environments can be deduced from state-of-the-art spectroscopic methods used in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we establish 195Pt solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a powerful methodology to acquire NMR signatures across a series of Pt-SACs dispersed on carbon based supports. Monte-Carlo simulations allow the conversion of NMR signatures into SAC fingerprints that describe local coordination environments with molecular precision and enable to quantitatively assess Pt-site distribution and homogeneity. This methodology can track the influence of synthetic parameters, e.g., specific protocols, synthetic steps and type of supports, on Pt-SAC structures, to guide the reproducible development of SACs with targeted structures; it also enables to monitor the change of coordination environment of SACs upon reaction. Such development provides a blueprint for the quantitative assessment of larger SAC families containing other NMR-active isotopes.

# Mapping Symptom-General and Symptom-Specific Targets for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Schizophrenia: An Electrical Modeling Meta-Analysis

## 精神分裂症经颅磁刺激的一般症状和症状特异性目标: 电建模荟萃分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5565115/latest

Negative, positive, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia relate to disruptions in partially distinct brain circuits. Although promising, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) strategies across and within symptom domains remain to be established due to TMS protocol heterogeneity. For this, we combined standard meta-analysis with electric field (E-field) modeling to identify stimulation sites where E-field strength associated most significantly with clinical improvement. Standard meta-analysis of randomized, sham-controlled studies in 3,806 patients demonstrated benefit of TMS across symptom domains, regardless of target or protocol. Particularly, TMS significantly improved negative and cognitive symptoms with high-frequency stimulation applied to left prefrontal cortex, whereas positive symptoms improved with low-frequency TMS applied to left temporoparietal cortex. In-depth examination of these results with E-field modeling identified stimulation to left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (L-DMPFC), left orbitofrontal cortex (L-OFC), and left cerebellar crus II and right lobule IX to be significantly associated with improvement across all symptom domains. Especially, greater overlap of studies&amp;rsquo; stimulation sites with L-DMPFC and L-OFC related to improved outcomes. For negative symptoms, E-field distribution in L-DMPFC and L-OFC related most significantly to clinical improvement. Specifically, greater proximity to L-DMPFC stimulation site indicated better outcomes, with at trend significance for L-OFC. In the cognitive domain, E-field distribution in frontopolar cortices and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex related to clinical improvement. Finally, strongest E-field association with clinical improvement was found in the right cerebellar lobules VIIIA, VIIIB, and IX for positive symptoms. These results support symptom-general and symptom-specific TMS approaches for distinct therapeutic goals towards personalized neuromodulation in schizophrenia.

# Investigation of the Effect of Feeding Gas Flowrate on the Titanium Particle Temperature in Radiofrequency Plasma Torch

## 进料气体流量对射频等离子体炬中钛颗粒温度影响的研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5756452/latest

In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed for a radio frequency (RF) plasma system designed for powder spheroidization. The electric field is generated analytically by solving the RF coil system, and then the resulting equations are implemented as user-defined functions (UDF) to the CFD model. UDF codes were created and defined in the Fluent program to generate RF plasma. Electromagnetic fields and fluid flow have been modelled in numerical analysis studies, and temperature and velocity distributions were obtained. The effect of this plasma environment on titanium particle temperature is investigated using various particle-feeding gas flow rates. As a result, it is observed that an optimal powder-feeding rate could be determined. It is seen that high particle velocities prevent the attainment of the necessary temperature for melting, while low velocities may cause the temperature to exceed the boiling point. These results conclude that the feeding gas flow rate could be determined for a specific powder size range to obtain the powder temperatures within the melting and boiling temperatures.

Information about groundwater resources in arid regions is certainly invaluable. Therefore, this study applied an integrated approach combining geophysical, remote sensing, and hydrogeological data in a GIS framework to analyze groundwater movement patterns and accumulation in the Desert Hydrogeological Region of Iraq, concentrating on the Saffawi area. The methodology incorporated gravity and magnetic data, satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 and ALOS PALSAR), digital elevation models, and a hydrogeological database. Analyses revealed evidence of neotectonic activity in the Saffawi area, marked by structural uplift reflected in positive gravity anomaly and fault activation near the Ediacaran basement. This uplift altered drainage patterns, promoted groundwater infiltration, and reshaped groundwater flow within the Umm Er Radhuma and Tayarat aquifers, forming the interconnected "Safawi Hydrogeological Flow System". The study emphasizes the role of tectonic activity in controlling groundwater dynamics and underscores the importance of multidisciplinary approaches in hydrogeological investigations.
