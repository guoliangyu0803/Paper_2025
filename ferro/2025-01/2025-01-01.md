**Authors:** Zhiyu Dong, Leonid Levitov, Patrick A. Lee

arXiv:2412.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems in which exchange interactions couple carrier spins to a spin texture with a net chirality exhibit a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, where the geometric gauge field and pseudo-magnetic field have opposite signs for carriers with opposite spins. As a result, Cooper pairs see a net zero vector potential and superconducting pairing is not hindered by pair-breaking effects. This allows superconductivity to occur even when the geometric field induces quantized Landau levels. We identify the dominant pairing order as an s-wave pair density wave of an FFLO type. Flat Landau levels can significantly enhance superconducting $T_c$, favoring superconductivity over competing orders. This exotic paired state features tell-tale signatures such as flat bands of Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles, manifest through Landau level-like resonances in the quasiparticle density of states.

Abstract: The dynamic magnetic properties of Full Heusler alloy thin films of Co$_2$FeGe, grown on MgO (001) substrates under different thermal conditions, were investigated. Brillouin light scattering and ferromagnetic resonance measurements revealed that depositing at room temperature followed by annealing at 300 deg C for 1 hour produces the best results for maximizing magnetization, exchange stiffness, and minimizing spin-dynamic dissipation in the films, which are desirable characteristics for high-speed spintronic devices. Additionally, strong hybridization of spin waves in the Damon-Eshbach geometry was observed, which is attractive for applications in magnonic signal processing circuits.

Abstract: We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

Abstract: We study a system of ultra cold dipolar Bose gas atoms confined in a two-dimensional (2D) harmonic trap with a dipolar impurity implanted at the center of the trap. Due to recent experimental progress in dipolar condensates, we focused on calculating properties of dipolar impurity systems that might guide experimentalists if they choose to study impurities in dipolar gases. We used the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism solved numerically via the split-step Crank-Nicolson method. We chose parameters of the background gas to be consistent with dysprosium (Dy), one of the strongest magnetic dipoles and of current experimental interest, and used chromium (Cr), erbium (Er), terbium (Tb), and Dy for the impurity. The dipole moments were aligned by an external field along what was chosen to be the z-axis, and studied 2D confinements that were perpendicular or parallel to the external field. We show density contour plots for the two confinements, 1D cross sections of the densities, calculated self-energies of the impurities while varying both number of atoms in the condensate and the symmetry of the trap. We also calculated the time evolution of the density of an initially pure system where an impurity is introduced. Our results found that while the self-energy increases in magnitude with increasing number of particles, it is reduced when the trap anisotropy follows the natural anisotropy of the gas, i.e., elongated along the z-axis in the case of parallel confinement. This work builds upon work done in Bose gases with zero-range interactions and demonstrates some of the features that could be found when exploring dipolar impurities in 2D Bose gases.

Abstract: Skyrmions refer to small swirling spin structures that emerge in ferromagnetic materials and show promising features to be used as a `bit' of information in future spintronic devices. Our research explores the possibility of nucleating skyrmions in X-Fe/Ir(111) multilayer nano-structure where, X is one of the 4d transition metals, such as, Pd, Rh, Ru, Mo and Nb. The resulting final state is determined by the competition between the frustrated exchange interaction, primarily contributed by the top 4d transition metal layer, and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced significantly by the 5d heavy metal Ir(111) layer. We apply a perpendicular dc magnetic field to the nano-structure and observe gradual phase transformation from the spin spiral ground state to a stable relaxed state of nano-scale skyrmions . A proper choice of magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leads to a range of external magnetic fields essential for the existence and stability of skyrmions. By raising the temperature, we assess the thermal stability of the nucleated skyrmions to evaluate their potential as information carriers in future spintronic devices.

Abstract: Spintronic Terahertz emitters, based on optically triggered spin-to-charge interconversion processes, have recently emerged as novel route towards compact and efficient THz sources. Yet, the next challenge for further technologically-relevant devices remains to modulate the emission, with low-energy consumption operation. To this aim, ferroelectric materials coupled to active spin-orbit layers such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are suitable candidates. In this work, we present the realization of a large area heterostructure of CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2 on a bi-domain LiNbO3 substrate. Using THz time-domain spectroscopy, we show that the ferroelectric polarization direction induces a sizeable modulation of the THz emission. We rationalise these experimental results by using band structure and spin accumulation calculations that are consistent with an interfacial spin-to-charge conversion mediated by inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the MoSe2/PtSe2 interface and being tuned by ferroelectricity in the adjacent LiNbO3 surface. This work points out the relevance of field effect spin-orbit architectures for novel THz technologies.

arXiv:2412.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit nonrelativistic spin splitting due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and have been garnering significant attention as promising materials for spintronic applications. In contrast, conventional antiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking and have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional antiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about nontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and nonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting spin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the electronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our prediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate its multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity. Our findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets, providing another perspective for designing spintronic materials.

**Authors:** Zhengtian Li, Zeyu Li, Zhenhua Qiao

arXiv:2412.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that Chern number tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and second-order topological insulators can be induced in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator (TI), i.e., Kane-Mele model, by applying $d$-wave altermagnetism. When the N\'eel vector of altermagentism lies in the $x-y$ plane, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TI is broken and driven into a second-order topological insulator phase, exhibiting the representative corner states at nanoflakes. When the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is further included, the second-order TI is further driven into the QAHE phase with various Chern numbers (e.g., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$ or $\pm3$). When the N\'eel vector is along $z$ direction, the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is necessary to break the mirror symmetry to allow a sequential emergence of second-order TI and QAHE along with the increase of altermagentism strength. We also observe the QAHE with mixed-chirality, i.e., there exist counter-propagating edge modes but net chiral current at the ribbon boundary. Our work shows that altermagnetism can play a crucial role in exploring a rich variety of topological phases, just like its counterparts of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.

**Authors:** Zeyu Li, Yulei Han, Zhenhua Qiao

arXiv:2412.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has been theoretically proposed in compensated antiferromagnetic systems by using the magnetic topological insulator model [see arXiv:2404.13305 (2024)]. However, the related and systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As the only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator, MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological states. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator model, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the physical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external hydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the dramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological nontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of pressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$ heterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations with QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable strategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.

Abstract: Antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as Mn3Sn, have emerged as promising platforms for exploring topological and correlated electron physics. Mn3Sn is known to show two magnetic phase transitions: a non-collinear inverse triangular antiferromagnetic (IT-AFM) spin configuration is formed below its Neel temperature, whereas at T1 that usually locates below room temperature, it transits to an incommensurate spin state. Accordingly, intriguing properties such as a strong anomalous Hall effect, observed from TN to T1, disappear below T1, limiting its utility at low temperatures. While bulk Mn3Sn has been extensively studied, the magnetic phase transitions and their tunability in thin films remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the magnetic and magneto-transport properties of Mn3+xSn1-x epitaxial thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering, systematically varying the Mn-Sn composition. Our results reveal that intrinsic alloying with Mn provides us with a handle to tune T1, with the IT-AFM phase stabilized down to liquid helium temperatures for x > 0.15. From a magnetic phase diagram for epitaxial thin films, we also find a consistent magnetic anomaly ~55 K below TN, accompanied by thermal hysteresis. Furthermore, the reduction of TN in thin films relative to bulk values is shown to correlate with lattice parameter changes. These findings extend the accessible temperature range for Mn3Sn's topological properties, paving the way for novel applications and further investigations into the interplay of spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom in thin-film geometries.

Abstract: Magnetic domain walls in antiferromagnets have been proposed as key components for faster conventional information processing, thanks to their enhanced stability and ultrafast propagation. However, how non-conventional computing methods like reservoir computing might take advantage of these properties remains an open question. In this work, we show how complex domain wall patterns can form through the proliferation of multiple domain walls from the energy stored in a single seed domain wall driven to move at a high speed close to the relativistic limit. We demonstrate that the resulting magnetic texture, consisting of up to hundreds of domain walls with an overall conserved topological charge as the initial seed domain wall, can possess chaotic spatiotemporal dynamics depending on the strength of staggered spin-orbit field induced via applied current. These findings allow us to design a multiple-domain-wall reservoir with high short-term memory and nonlinearity with respect to spin-orbit field inputs, that is suitable for ultrafast, energy-efficient, non-conventional reservoir computing.

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e homobilayers have emerged as a platform in which magnetism, strong correlations, and topology are intertwined. In a large magnetic field, the energetic alignment of states with different spin in these systems is dictated by both strong Zeeman splitting and the structure of the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum, yet the latter has been difficult to probe experimentally. Here we conduct local thermodynamic measurements of twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers that reveal a cascade of magnetic phase transitions. We understand these transitions as the filling of individual Hofstadter subbands, allowing us to extract the structure and connectivity of the Hofstadter spectrum of a single spin. The onset of magnetic transitions is independent of twist angle, indicating that the exchange interactions of the component layers are only weakly modified by the moir\'e potential. In contrast, the magnetic transitions are associated with stark changes in the insulating states at commensurate filling. Our work achieves a spin-resolved measurement of Hofstadter's butterfly despite overlapping states, and it disentangles the role of material and moir\'e effects on the nature of the correlated ground states.

# Designing Spin-driven Multiferroics in Altermagnets

**Authors:** Ranquan Cao, Ruizhi Dong, Ruixiang Fei, Yugui Yao

arXiv:2412.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-driven multiferroics exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling, with notable polarization changes under a magnetic field, but these effects are usually limited to high-Z magnetic insulators with low electronic polarization. In this work, we introduce altermagnets as a promising platform for achieving strong magnetoelectric coupling in low-Z systems with substantial polarization. This large polarization arises from a design principle that utilizes the Heisenberg-like exchange striction mechanism, eliminating the reliance on spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This approach enables the Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic phase derived from altermagnetic insulators to achieve substantial polarization without spin splitting, providing a flexible platform for regulating spin-splitting phenomena. Through first-principles simulations and an effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that materials in the LiMnO2 family and strained RuF4 family can achieve polarization values exceeding 1.0 {\mu}C/cm2, an order of magnitude larger than those found in SOC-driven multiferroics. Moreover, their magnetoelectric coupling is one to two orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in conventional multiferroics and those driven by SOC.

Abstract: Although the relationship between magnetostriction and magnetic damping is often described phenomenologically, their intrinsic connection remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the magnitude of magnetic damping depends on the sign of magnetostriction in ($\mathrm{Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{4}N}$ and $\mathrm{Ni_{1-y}Co_{y}}$ alloys across various compositions, consistent with experimental observations. This behavior is attributed to strain-induced changes in exchange splitting, which shift the minority spin density of states near the Fermi level, thereby affecting both magnetostriction and damping through spin-conserving transitions. Additionally, the presence of locally degenerate orbitals plays a crucial role in determining magnetostriction. These findings suggest that magnetization dynamics and magnetostriction can be intrinsically controlled, facilitating the design of magnetic materials for applications such as flexible spintronics.

Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.

Abstract: An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.

**Authors:** Erol Vatansever, Mikel Quintana, Andreas Berger

arXiv:2412.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the crossover of critical behavior for the dynamic phase transition (DPT) in ferromagnetic thin films using Monte Carlo simulations of the kinetic Ising model, focusing on the scaling behavior of the dynamic order parameter under a time-dependent external magnetic field. Specifically, we study the transition of the critical behavior of such film systems from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as a function of the film thickness and the distance to the critical point, which enables dimensional crossover observations. Our results indicate that the effective critical exponents exhibit a clear transition in their scaling behavior, with thinner films showing 2D-like characteristics and thicker films displaying 3D-like behavior, for both the DPT and the thermodynamic phase transitions (TPT). Quantitatively, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior occurs at larger film thicknesses for the DPT compared to the TPT, suggesting that DPT and TPT are governed by distinctly different length scales and underlying surface effects. These findings are in agreement with experimental observations in ultrathin Co films, where dynamic and thermodynamic critical exponents were found to differ. Therefore, our study provides an in-depth explanation for critical phenomena in thin-film ferromagnets driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. By comparing the dimensional crossover properties of both TPT and DPT, we present a comprehensive understanding of how thin-film geometry and surface effects influence the scaling laws and critical behavior in nonequilibrium systems.

It has long been observed that the Potts color symmetry breaking for the spin glass order parameter is closely related to the ferromagnetic phase transition. To clarify this, we identify a single critical value $t_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of both color symmetry breaking and the transition to ferromagnetism.

Abstract: How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.

Abstract: Weyl fermions can arise from time-reversal symmetry-breaking magnetism, but their impact on magnetic order is a source of ongoing research. Using high-precision neutron diffraction and spectroscopy, we present a comprehensive exploration of the magnetic structure and excitation spectrum of Weyl semimetal and helical magnet NdAlSi. We use Luttinger-Tisza, classical mean-field, and random-phase approximation techniques to model the dispersive crystal field excitons. We find extended-ranged and sign-changing interactions, suggesting a coupling between conduction electrons and the local moments. We demonstrate that low-symmetry anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in contrast with higher-symmetry interactions enabled by Weyl fermions, play an important role in stabilizing the complex spin spiral ground state of NdAlSi. Our work provides a first detailed view of microscopic interactions in a Weyl magnet, and constrains the role of Weyl electrons and their chirality on the spiral magnetism.

Abstract: Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been observed in an epitaxial L1$_1$-ordered CoPt/CuPt bilayer and attributed to spin-orbit torque (SOT) arising from the crystallographic $3m$ point group of the interface. Using a first-principles nonequilibrium Green's function formalism combined with the Anderson disorder model, we calculate the angular dependence of the SOT in a CoPt/CuPt bilayer and find that the magnitude of the $3m$ SOT is about 20% of the conventional dampinglike SOT. We further study the magnetization dynamics in perpendicularly magnetized films in the presence of $3m$ SOT and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, using the equations of motion for domain wall dynamics and micromagnetic simulations. We find that for systems with strong interfacial DMI characterized by the N\'eel character of domain walls, a very large current density is required to achieve deterministic switching because reorientation of the magnetization inside the domain wall is necessary to induce the switching asymmetry. For thicker films with relatively weak interfacial DMI and the Bloch character of domain walls the deterministic switching with much smaller currents is possible, which agrees with recent experimental findings.

Abstract: High-pressure synthesis can be an effective method for improving the sample quality of materials as well as their superconducting properties. In this paper, the synthesis process of F- doped SmFeAsO has been optimized by preparing a series of bulk SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111) using the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method, considering various growth parameters like growth pressures (0-1 GPa) and heating time (0.5-2 h). Structural, microstructural, Raman spectroscopic, transport, and magnetic measurements are employed to comprehensively analyze these bulks and derive the conclusive findings. The parent SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 prepared by the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) has a transition temperature (Tc) of around 53-54 K, and the critical current density (Jc) of 103 A/cm2 at 5 K with a small amount of the impurity phases (SmOF and SmAs), consistent with previous reports. Interestingly, all bulks synthesized by HP-HTS have almost the same Tc and Jc as the parent sample. The optimal growth conditions are obtained as 900C, 1 hour, and 0.5 GPa with the sealed Ta-tube, which slightly improved the sample quality and the superconducting properties compared to other bulks grown by HP-HTS. Our study confirms that the existence of the impurity phases in the 1111 family is very robust and cannot be reduced by HP-HTS, leading to only a small variation in the observed superconducting properties of Sm1111 whether prepared by CSP or HP-HTS. This is the first comprehensive investigation of the high-pressure development of Sm1111, which shows distinct behaviour from other families of iron-based superconductors.

Abstract: We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half-filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations, and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half-filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.

Abstract: Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.

Abstract: Weinvestigate the topological phase transition of Kitaev spin liquid in an external magnetic field by calculating
  the Berry curvature and the Fubini-Study metric. Employing Jordan-Wigner transformation and effective
  perturbative theory to transform the Hamiltonian into fermionic quadratic form, the Berry curvature is calculated
  by choosing the effective magnetic field as the parameter, and we find that the xy-component of the Berry
  curvature has the same behavior around the critical lines with the phase diagram and the behavior of Berry
  curvature around the critical line will not be influenced by local perturbation, i.e. it has the robustness against
  the local perturbation. Especially, we relate the Berry curvature with the derivative of effective magnetic
  susceptibility which can be regarded as the signature of topological phase transition besides, we related the
  second nonlinear susceptibility with the non-Abelian Berry connection. Then we analytically calculate the
  generalized Berry curvature in the mixed state called mean Uhlmann curvature which can be related with the
  spectral function, the curves that mean Uhlmanncurvaturechangingtemperaturewithdifferentcouplingconstant
  reveal that it will have an extrema when adjust $J_x$ from $A$ phase to $B$ phase. At last we analytically calculate the
  quantum geometric tensor in the effective magnetic field space whose imaginary part is the Berry curvature and
  real part is the Fubini-Study metric, and we find that the zz-component of Fubini-Study metric and the phase
  diagram are highly correlated which will peak at the cross point of three phases, then the Fubini-Study metric
  is extended to the finite temperature with arising an additional term called Fisher-Rao metric caused by mixed

**Authors:** Heng Wu, Yaojia Wang, Mazhar N. Ali

arXiv:2412.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity has been investigated for over a century, but there are still open questions about what determines the critical current; the maximum current a superconductor can carry before switching to its normal state. For a given superconductor, the zero-field critical current is widely believed to be determined by its inherent properties and be related to its critical magnetic field. Here, by studying superconducting polycrystalline films, single crystal flakes, and layered heterostructures, we find that the critical current of a superconductor can vary with measurement configuration. It can be influenced, or even determined, by adjacent superconducting segments along the applied current trajectory, whereas the critical magnetic field and critical temperature remain unaffected. This global critical current effect both reveals the need to revisit fundamental theory describing superconductivity, as well as implies that superconductors can transfer critical current related properties to each other. We demonstrate this by designing and fabricating a simple superconducting structure that transferred a superconducting diode effect from one segment to another segment which could not manifest the effect on its own. This observation merits a reconsideration of contemporary superconducting circuit design, and developing a full understanding will lead to a new paradigm of superconducting electronics.

Abstract: The spin-12 three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder is studied under open boundary condition (OBC) and cylinder boundary condition (CBC), using the density matrix renormalization group and matrix product state methods, respectively. Specifically, we calculate the energy density, entanglement entropy, and concurrence while discussing the effects of interleg interaction J2 and the alternating coupling parameter gamma on these quantities. It is found that the introduction of gamma can completely reverse the concurrence distribution between odd and even bonds. Under CBC, the generation of the interleg concurrence is inhibited when gamma=0, and the introduction of gamma can cause interleg concurrence between chains 1 and 3, in which the behavior is more complicated due to the competition between CBC and gamma. Additionally, we find that gamma induces two types of long-distance entanglement (LDE) in the system under OBC: intraleg LDE and inter-leg one. When the system size is sufficiently large, both types of LDE reach similar strength and stabilize at a constant value. The study indicates that the three-leg ladder makes it easier to generate LDE compared with the two-leg system. However, the generation of LDE is inhibited under CBC which the spin frustration exists. In addition, the calculated results of energy, entanglement entropy and concurrence all show that there are essential relations between these quantities and phase transitions of the system. Further, we predict a phase transition point near gamma=0.54 under OBC. The present study provides valuable insights into understanding the phase diagram of this class of systems.

Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for information applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.

Abstract: Materials manifesting the Kitaev model, characterized by bond-dependent interactions on a honeycomb lattice, can host exotic phenomena like quantum spin liquid states and topological magnetic excitations. However, finding such materials remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on VI3, a van der Waals ferromagnetic Mott insulator, covering a wide range of reciprocal space. Our measurements unveil highly anisotropic magnetic excitations in momentum space. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis of various models that incorporate diverse symmetry-allowed magnetic interactions, we find the observed excitations are well captured by a model with a large bond-dependent Kitaev interaction. These results not only help to understand the intriguing properties of VI3, such as the pronounced anomalous thermal Hall effects and strong pressure/structure dependence of magnetism, but also open a new avenue for exploring Kitaev physics.

Abstract: Magnetic materials phase reconstruction from Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements has traditionally been achieved using longstanding methods such as off-axis holography (OAH) and the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE). Amidst the increase in access to processing power and the development of advanced algorithms, phase retrieval of nanoscale magnetic materials with higher fidelity and resolution, potentially down to the few nanometer limit, becomes possible. Specifically, reverse-mode automatic differentiation (RMAD) and the extended electron ptychography iterative engine (ePIE) are two methods that have been utilized for high confidence phase reconstructions using LTEM through-focal series imaging and Lorentz scanning TEM (Ltz-4D-STEM), respectively. This work evaluates phase retrieval using TIE, RMAD, and ePIE in simulations consisting of an array of Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) nanoscale islands. Extending beyond simulations, we demonstrate total phase reconstructions of a NiFe nanowire using OAH and RMAD in LTEM and ePIE in Ltz-4D-STEM experiments and determine the magnetization saturation through corroborations with micromagnetic simulations. Finally, we show how the total phase shift gradient can be utilized to observe and characterize the proximity effects emanating from neighboring magnetic island interactions and an isolated NiFe nanowire.

arXiv:2412.21064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect arises from strong electron correlations in a quantising magnetic field, and features exotic emergent phenomena such as electron fractionalisation. Using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach with the combinatorial summation algorithm, we obtain results with controlled accuracy for the microscopic model of interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level. As the temperature is lowered, we study the development and emergence of the incompressible 1/3-filled FQH state. By analysing the long-time decay of the Green's function, we find spectral properties consistent with an energy gap near 1/3-filling, while at half-filling an anomalous power law scaling is observed for short-range interaction screening, indicative of a non-Fermi liquid metal. Our work provides the first demonstration that fractionalised phases of matter can be reliably described with Feynman's diagrammatic technique in terms of the fundamental electronic degrees of freedom, while also showing applicability of expansions in the bare Coulomb potential for precision calculations.

Abstract: Wurtzite LaN (wz-LaN) is a semiconducting nitride with favorable piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, making it promising for applications in electronics. We use first-principles density functional theory with a hybrid functional to investigate several features that are key for its use in heterostructures. First, for the purposes of growing wz-LaN on a substrate or designing a heterostructure, we show that it can be lattice-matched with a number of cubic materials along their [111] axes. We also evaluate the bound charge at such interfaces, taking into account both the polarization discontinuity and the piezoelectric polarization due to pseudomorphic strain. Second, we investigate band alignments and assess the results for interfaces with zincblende-, rocksalt-, and perovskite-structure compounds, and with chemically similar wurtzite and rocksalt nitrides. Our results provide guidance for the development of electronic devices based on wz-LaN.

Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional magnets can host an ordered longitudinal spin-density wave state (LSDW) in magnetic field at low temperature, when longitudinal correlations are strengthened by Ising anisotropies. In the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet YbAlO3 this happens via Ising-like interchain interactions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of magnetization plateaux at 1/5 and 1/3 of the saturation value via thermal transport and magnetostriction measurements in YbAlO3. We present a phenomenological theory of the plateau states that describes them as islands of commensurability within an otherwise incommensurate LSDW phase and explains their relative positions within the LSDW phase and their relative extent in a magnetic field. Notably, the plateaux are stabilised by ferromagnetic interchain interactions in YbAlO3 and consistently are absent in other quasi-1D magnets such as BaCo2V2O8 with antiferromagnetic interchain interactions. We also report a sharp, step-like increase of the magnetostriction coefficient, indicating a phase transition of unknown origin in the high-field phase just below the saturation.

Abstract: Simple local interactions can cause primitive building blocks to self-assemble into complex and functional patterns. However, even for a small number of blocks, there exist a vast number of possible configurations that are plausible, stable, and with varying degree of order. The ability to dynamically shift between multi-stable patterns (i.e., reprogram the self-assembly) entails navigating an intractable search space, which remains a challenge. In this paper, we engineer the self-assembly of macroscopic magnetic particles to create metamaterials with dynamically reversible emergent phases. We utilize a boundary composed of magnetic hinges to confine free-floating magnetic disks into different stable assemblies. We exploit the non-destructive nature of the magnetic boundaries to create re-programmable two-dimensional metamaterials that morphs from crystalline to quasi-crystalline to disordered assembly using the same number of disks and boundary. Furthermore, we explore their utility to control the propagation of sound waves in an effectively undamped media with rich nonlinearities. Our findings can expand the metamaterials horizon into functional and tunable devices.

arXiv:2412.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic magnetic response in a trilayered structure with non-equivalent layers (ABA type) has been studied with Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis algorithm. In each layer, ferromagnetic (FM) nearest neighbour Ising interactions are present along with antiferromagnetic (AFM) nearest neighbour coupling across different layers. The system is studied under a harmonically oscillating external magnetic field. It is revealed that along with dynamic phase transition (DPT), compensation phenomenon emerges in this system under dynamic scenario too. This feature in dynamic case is unique for such trilayered systems only, in contrast to the bulk system reported earlier. The temporal behaviour of the magnetisation of each individual layer shows that different magnetic response of the non-equivalent layers results into such dynamic compensation phenomenon. The difference in response also results into warping of the dynamic hysteresis loops, under various external parameter values, such as amplitude of the oscillating field and temperature.

Abstract: The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.

Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.

Abstract: Polymer network models construct the constitutive relationships of a broader polymer network from the behavior of a single polymer chain (e.g. viscoelastic response to applied forces, applied electromagnetic fields, etc.). Network models have been used for multiscale phenomena in a variety of contexts such as rubber elasticity, soft multifunctional materials, biological materials, and even the curing of polymers. For decades, a myriad of polymer network models have been developed with differing numbers of chains, arranged in different ways, and with differing symmetries. To complicate matters further, there are also competing assumptions for how macroscopic variables (e.g. deformation) are related to individual chains within the network model. In this work, we propose a simple, intuitive assumption for how the network locally rotates relative to applied loading (e.g. stresses, external fields) and show that this assumption unifies many of the disparate polymer network models--while also recovering one of the most successful models for rubber elasticity, the Arruda-Boyce $8$-chain model. The new assumption is then shown to make more intuitive predictions (than prior models) for stimuli-responsive networks with orientational energies (e.g. electroactive polymers), which is significant for shape morphing and designing high degree of freedom actuators (e.g. for soft robotics). Lastly, we unveil some surprising consequences of the new model for the phases of multistable biopolymer and semi-crystalline networks.

Abstract: Superconductivity in single-layer graphene has attracted considerable interest. Here, using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study transitions of superconductivity and magnetism in a monolayer graphene with a special periodic strain. Consistent with experiments, the deformation accumulates a series of flat bands, whose robustness under interaction is verified through electron localization in real space. During the reconstruction of the band structure, the superconductivity appears in flat band range with next-nearest neighbor $d+id$ pairing symmetry dominating other modes and is accompanied by ferromagnetism caused by symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate that the strain-induced symmetry breaking would accumulate an energy-gap antiferromagnetic insulating phase at half filling even under the limitation of not strong enough interaction, which shows its potential as a platform that exhibits strongly correlated phenomena.

Abstract: The notion of "half fire, half ice" was recently introduced to describe an exotic macroscopic ground-state degeneracy emerging in a ferrimagnet under the critical magnetic field, in which the "hot" spins are fully disordered on the sublattice with smaller magnetic moments and the "cold" spins are fully ordered on the sublattice with larger magnetic moments. Here we further point out that this state has a twin named "half ice, half fire" in which the hot and cold spins switch positions. The new state is an excited state -- thus hidden in the ground-state phase diagram -- and is robust with respect to the interactions that destroy the half fire, half ice state. We demonstrate with exact results how this hidden state can drive phase switching at desirable finite temperature, even for the one-dimensional Ising model where phase transition at finite temperature is forbidden. We suggest that our findings may open a new door to the understanding and controlling of phase competition and transition in unconventional frustrated systems.

Abstract: To control the magnon transport in magnetic systems is of great interest in magnonics. Due to the feasibility of electric field, how to generate and manipulate magnon with pure electrical method is one of the most desired goals. Here we propose that the magnon spin current is generated by applying time-dependent electric field, where the coupling between the magnon and electric field is invoked via Aharonov-Casher effect. In particular, the magnon spin current is dominated by electric field component which perpendicular to the magnetization direction. We apply our theory to 1D ferromagnetic SSH model and show that the generated magnon spin current is closely related to the band geometry. Our findings expands the horizons of magnonics and electric-control-magnon mechanisms.

Abstract: The discovery of a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and its novel mechanism holds significant promise for advancing both fundamental research and practical applications. Magnetic kagome lattice materials are uniquely suited for studying the AHE due to their interplay between electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. However, the geometric frustration inherent in kagome lattices often limits the configuration and tunability of magnetic order. Here, we present a new design strategy for kagome-lattice materials with emergent magnetism, exemplified by the magnetic kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which features interwoven magnetic Tb zigzag chains and non-magnetic Ti kagome bilayers. This material exhibits a record-high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 10$^5$ $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$. Spectroscopy measurements reveal a large band folding gap observed via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, coexisting spin-density-wave (SDW) order detected through spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and a spiral magnetic order with large magnetic moments identified by neutron diffraction. These findings highlight a strong electron-magnetic coupling between itinerant charges and ordered magnetic moments, offering a spectroscopic explanation for the giant AHC in TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$. This work establishes a pathway for innovative material design strategies, unlocking new possibilities for future exploration and applications in quantum and spintronic technologies.

Abstract: $\beta$-Tungsten ($\beta$-W), an A15 cubic phase of tungsten, exhibits a giant spin Hall angle compared to its bcc-phase $\alpha$-Tungsten ($\alpha$-W), making high-quality $\beta$-W films desirable for spintronic applications. We report the controlled growth of $\beta$-W films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates via DC sputtering, where substrate bias serves as a critical factor in stabilizing the $\beta$ phase by regulating the energy of deposited atoms. This approach enables the formation of $\beta$-W films over a wide thickness range. Additionally, we studied the spin pumping phenomena in different tungsten phases achieved through substrate bias. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements reveal an enhancement in the magnetic damping (\( \alpha_{\text{eff}} \)) for $\beta$-W/Py compared to $\alpha$-W/Py dominated film. The effective spin mixing conductance (\( g_{\text{eff}}^{\uparrow\downarrow} \)) is found to be higher in $\beta$-W/Py than in $\alpha$-W/Py, which is attributed to variations in the interface structures between these phases. Importantly, the use of substrate bias does not deteriorate the interface quality, underscoring its effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of substrate bias in thin-film engineering, paving the way for its advanced utilization in spintronic applications.

Abstract: The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations can induce rich phenomena at finite temperatures in strongly correlated fermion systems. Here we report a {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) study for the finite-temperature properties of three-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model at half filling. We concentrate on the complete temperature-interaction strength phase diagram of the model, which contains the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phase and metal-insulator crossover (MIC) in the paramagnetic phase. Enabling access to unprecedented system sizes up to $20^3$, we achieve highly accurate results of the N\'{e}el transition temperature for representative values of on-site interaction $U$ via finite-size analysis of AFM structure factor. To quantitatively characterize the MIC above the N\'{e}el transition, we have developed fully new techniques allowing to compute the thermal entropy versus $U$ at fixed temperature and to directly calculate the $U$-derivative of double occupancy in AFQMC simulations. Then combining variously thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish an efficient scheme to precisely determine the boundaries for the MIC by cross-checking different observables. We also demonstrate the temperature dependence of many commonly used observables. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and AFM spin correlation versus hole doping, and demonstrate the persistance of N\'{e}el AFM ordered phase to finite doping with limited results.

Abstract: Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. First, by exciting the sample with an intense THz pulse and probing the magnetization dynamics using magneto-optical Faraday effect, we find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via the THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects and paves the way towards novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.

Abstract: Strain modulation is a crucial way in engineering nanoscale materials. It is even more important for single photon emitters in layered materials, where strain can create quantum emitters and control their energies. Here we report the localized, charge-enhanced coupling between the charged localized emitters in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) to the piezoelectric relaxor ferroelectric substrate. In addition to the strain effect, we observe a gigantic polarizability volume with the enhancement factor up to 1010. The enormous polarizability leads to a large Quantum-confined Stark shift under a small variation of electric field, indicating the potential of integrating layered materials with functional substrates for quantum sensing. We further demonstrate the tunable diamagnetic shift and g-factor with strain varying by ~0.05%, which confirms the existence of enhanced interaction between the localized oscillating dipoles and the ferroelectric domains. Our results signify the prospect of charged quantum emitters in layered materials for quantum sciences and technology.

Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.

Abstract: Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG residing on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium monoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly spin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\,\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular distribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how the induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the overlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that the EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO overlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers. Additional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus the spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the magnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects indicate that the EuO/STO (001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional spin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semianalytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As a demonstration of their capabilities, we show that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.

Abstract: Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting can emerge in the AB-stacking configurations. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP2S6, MnPX3 can show switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on its band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.

Abstract: The exact recursion relations are used to study the mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2) Blume-Capel Ising ferrimagnetic system on the Bethe lattice. Ground-state phase diagrams are computed in the $({D_{A}}/{q|J|}, {D_{B}}/{q|J|})$ plane to reveal different possible ground states of the model. Using the thermal changes of the order-parameters, interesting temperature dependent phase diagrams are constructed in the ($D_{A}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$), ($D_{B}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) planes as well as in the ($D/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) plane where $D=D_A=D_B$. It is revealed that the system exhibits first- and second-order phase transitions and compensation temperatures for specific model parameter values. Under the constraint of an external magnetic field, the model also produces multi-hysteresis behaviors as single, double and triple hysteresis cycles. Particularly, the impacts of the ferrimagnetic coupling $J$ on the remanent magnetization and the coercitive fields for selected values of the other physical parameters of the system are pointed out. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with those reported in the literature.

Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.

Abstract: Following the concept of creating individual centers, we investigate local electronic states and magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO) induced by substituting oxygen (O) with nitrogen (N). Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.

Abstract: Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.

Abstract: We present a non-perturbative framework for incorporating gauge field fluctuations into effective actions of QED3 in the infrared using fermionic particle-vortex duality. This approach is demonstrated through the applications to models containing N species of 2-component Dirac fermions in solvable and interpretable electromagnetic backgrounds, focusing on N = 1 or 2. For the N = 1 model, we establish a correspondence between fermion Casimir energy at finite density and the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, and further evaluate the corrections to their amplitudes. This predicts amplification of charge susceptibility and reduction of magnetic permeability. We additionally provide physical interpretations for each component of our calculation and offer alternative derivations based on energy density measurements in different characteristic lengths. For N = 2, we show that magnetic catalysis is erased in a U(1)xU(1) QED3, indicating no breakdown of chiral symmetry. Reasoning is offered based on the properties of the lowest Landau level wave functions.

Abstract: Following seminal work by J. Fr\"ohlich and T.

No assumptions that the nearest-neighbor interaction $J(1)$ is large are made. The robustness of the method also yields a proof of phase transition in the presence of a nonsummable external field that decays sufficiently fast.

Abstract: Precise magnetometry is vital in numerous scientific and technological applications. At the forefront of sensitivity, optical atomic magnetometry, particularly techniques utilizing nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR), enables ultraprecise measurements across a broad field range. Despite their potential, these techniques reportedly lose sensitivity at higher magnetic fields, which is attributed to the alignment-to-orientation conversion (AOC) process. In our study, we utilize light with continuously rotating linear polarization to avoid AOC, producing robust optical signals and achieving high magnetometric sensitivity over a dynamic range nearly three times greater than Earth's magnetic field. We demonstrate that employing rotating polarization surpasses other NMOR techniques that use modulated light. Our findings also indicate that the previously observed signal deterioration is not due to AOC, suggesting an alternative cause for this decline.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that the optical Orbital Hall Effect (OHE) is analogous to the Spin Hall Effect (SHE). However, it has been reported that these two types of phenomena are fundamentally distinct in curved spacetime. In this paper, we construct a vortex Laguerre-Gaussian electromagnetic wave packet and analyze its motion by solving the covariant Maxwell equations in a specialized optical material that is equivalent to curved spacetime. Our findings reveal that, within media, the relationships between intrinsic orbital angular momentum-dependent and spin-dependent separations can differ significantly. These results suggest that the optical OHE in materials cannot be accurately predicted by merely substituting spin with intrinsic orbital angular momentum in the SHE. Additionally, we compute the maximum deviation angle of the OHE in two experimentally viable optical materials. According to our results, in the first material, the transverse displacement can be successfully detected using current experimental techniques, which can serve as a reference for future experimental observations.

Abstract: We investigate the radiation of surface polaritons by an annular beam that coaxially encloses a cylindrical waveguide surrounded by a homogeneous medium. By using the Green dyadic, the electromagnetic potentials and the electric and magnetic fields are found inside and outside the waveguide. The expression for the energy losses is derived for the general case of the dispersion for dielectric permittivities inside and outside the cylinder. A comprehensive analysis is presented in the spectral range corresponding to the radiation of surface polaritons. The highest peaks in the spectral distribution are obtained for intermediate values of the beam velocity. In the limit of transparent medium the spectrum of radiated surface polaritons is discrete and the corresponding frequencies are determined by the eigenvalue equation for the cylindrical waveguide. Numerical examples are presented for the Drude model of dispersion.

Abstract: A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level magnetic fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a uniform and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and tunable field configuration is useful for 2-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. In this work, by aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) to the zero-field line of a 2-foil-based planar 2D-MOT, we demonstrate field-free operation of the quantum optical interface in a quasi-continuous manner, without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy is performed with a measurement repetition rate as high as 250~kHz. An anomalous line broadening is observed, which is not fully understood, but is partly explained by a small residual field along the zero-field line. Through additional field measurements and simulations, we clarify that this residual field can be eliminated in an $n$=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap to support efficient sub-Doppler cooling and uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long field-free distances $l$. With the strong field gradient to support atom guiding, the ferromagnetic device may also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons.

Abstract: The effects of negative triangularity (NT) on boundary plasma turbulence in double-null (DN) configurations are investigated using global, nonlinear, three-dimensional, flux-driven two-fluid simulations. NT plasmas exhibit suppressed interchange-driven instabilities, resulting in enhanced confinement and lower fluctuation levels compared to positive triangularity (PT) plasmas. This reduction in interchange instability is associated with the weakening of curvature effects in the unfavorable region, caused by the stretching of magnetic field lines at the outer midplane. The magnetic disconnection between the turbulent low-field side (LFS) and the quiescent high-field side (HFS) results in most of the heat flux reaching the DN outer targets. In NT plasmas, the power load on the outer target is reduced, while it increases on the inner target, indicating a reduced in-out power asymmetry compared PT plasmas. Furthermore, the analysis of power load asymmetry between the upper and lower targets shows that the up-down power asymmetry is mitigated in NT plasmas, mainly due to the reduced total power crossing the separatrix. The reduction of interchange instabilities in NT plasmas also affects the blob dynamics. A three-dimensional blob analysis reveals that NT plasmas feature smaller blob sizes and slower propagation velocities. Finally, an analytical scaling law for blob size and velocity that includes plasma shaping effects is derived based on the two-region model and is found to qualitatively capture the trends observed in nonlinear simulations.

Abstract: The current study, as part of a PhD project on the design of a helicon thruster, aims to provide a rational methodology for the design of the helicon thruster's main component, i.e., the helicon antenna. A helicon thruster is an innovative electrodeless plasma thruster that works by exciting helicon waves in a magnetized plasma, and its antenna is capable of producing a uniform, low-temperature, high-density plasma. A magnetic nozzle is used to accelerate the exhaust plasma in order to generate a propulsive thrust. In this paper, we consider a simple helicon antenna, specifically the Nagoya type-III antenna. We consider a common experimental setup consisting of a quartz tube with finite length containing a uniform magnetized plasma and a Nagoya type-III antenna placed at the tube centre. Considering previous studies on helicon waves theory, we compare three different design methods, each based on simplifying different modelling assumptions, and evaluate the predictions of these models with results from full-wave 3D simulations. In particular, we concentrate on deriving a rational design method for the helicon antenna length, given the dimension of the quartz tube and the desired target plasma parameters. This work aims to provide a practical and fast method for dimensioning the antenna length, useful for initializing more accurate but computationally heavier full-wave simulations in 3D geometry or simply for a rapid prototyping of the helicon antenna. These results can be useful for the development of a helicon thruster but also for the design of a high-density radiofrequency plasma source.

Nuclear spin dependent contributions of the weak interaction are expected to result in energetic differences between enantiomers manifesting in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra as chemical shift differences on the order of $10^{-6}$ Hz to $10^{-3}$ Hz for high-$Z$ nuclei. By employing simultaneous measurements of the diastereomeric splittings for a light and a heavy nucleus in solution-state NMR, residual chemical shift differences persisting in non-chiral environment between enantiomers of chiral compounds smaller than the typical linewidth of high-field NMR may be resolved. Sources of error must be identified and minimized to verify that the observed effect is, in fact, due to parity violation and not systematic effects. This paper presents a detailed analysis of a system incorporating \textsuperscript{31}P and \textsuperscript{1}H NMR to elucidate the systematic effects and to guide experiments with higher-$Z$ nuclei where molecular parity violation may be resolved.

Abstract: Over the past three decades, a lot of coronal fast-mode waves were detected by space missions, but their counterparts in the chromosphere, called the Moreton waves, were rarely captured. How this happens remains a mystery. Here, to shed light on this problem, we investigate the photospheric vector magnetograms of the Moreton wave events associated with M- and X-class solar flares in 2010--2023. The H$\alpha$ data are taken with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). Our statistical results show that more than 80\% of the events occur at the edge of active regions and propagate non-radially due to asymmetric magnetic fields above the flares. According to the reconstructed magnetic field and atmospheric model, Moreton waves propagate in the direction along which the horizontal fast-mode wave speed drops the fastest. The result supports that the inclined magnetic configuration of the eruption is crucial to generate Moreton waves, even for X-class flares. It may explain the low occurrence rate of Moreton waves and why some X-class flares accompanied with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) do not generate Moreton waves.

Abstract: In wave propagation problems, finite difference methods implemented on staggered grids are commonly used to avoid checkerboard patterns and to improve accuracy in the approximation of short-wavelength components of the solutions. In this study, we develop a mimetic finite difference (MFD) method on staggered grids for transport operators with divergence-free advective field that is proven to be energy-preserving in wave problems. This method mimics some characteristics of the summation-by-parts (SBP) operators framework, in particular it preserves the divergence theorem at the discrete level. Its design is intended to be versatile and applicable to wave problems characterized by a divergence-free velocity. As an application, we consider the electrostatic shear Alfv\'en waves (SAWs), appearing in the modeling of plasmas. These waves are solved in a magnetic field configuration recalling that of a tokamak device. The study of the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the SAWs shows the energy conservation of the discretization scheme, demonstrating the stability of the numerical solution.

Abstract: High-pressure synthesis can be an effective method for improving the sample quality of materials as well as their superconducting properties. In this paper, the synthesis process of F- doped SmFeAsO has been optimized by preparing a series of bulk SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111) using the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method, considering various growth parameters like growth pressures (0-1 GPa) and heating time (0.5-2 h). Structural, microstructural, Raman spectroscopic, transport, and magnetic measurements are employed to comprehensively analyze these bulks and derive the conclusive findings. The parent SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 prepared by the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) has a transition temperature (Tc) of around 53-54 K, and the critical current density (Jc) of 103 A/cm2 at 5 K with a small amount of the impurity phases (SmOF and SmAs), consistent with previous reports. Interestingly, all bulks synthesized by HP-HTS have almost the same Tc and Jc as the parent sample. The optimal growth conditions are obtained as 900C, 1 hour, and 0.5 GPa with the sealed Ta-tube, which slightly improved the sample quality and the superconducting properties compared to other bulks grown by HP-HTS. Our study confirms that the existence of the impurity phases in the 1111 family is very robust and cannot be reduced by HP-HTS, leading to only a small variation in the observed superconducting properties of Sm1111 whether prepared by CSP or HP-HTS. This is the first comprehensive investigation of the high-pressure development of Sm1111, which shows distinct behaviour from other families of iron-based superconductors.

Abstract: Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.

Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for information applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.

# Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation

Abstract: We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.

Abstract: In this study, we utilize intense laser pulses and advanced quantum mechanical frameworks to investigate the behavior of high-velocity electrons within magnetized plasma environments. The focus of our research is placed within the context of strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED), an area that explores the interaction of intense electromagnetic fields with charged particles. We propose new theoretical solutions that accurately describe these interactions by incorporating the effects of both the relativistic mass increase of fast-moving electrons and the influence of the electromagnetic field (or "light itself") within the plasma medium. Our approach diverges from traditional models by offering a more comprehensive treatment of the complex dynamics at play in these extreme conditions. Standard models of laser-plasma interactions often fail to capture the full spectrum of physical phenomena that arise when strong magnetic fields are present. In particular, the traditional assumptions about electron motion and radiation emission become less accurate, as the interplay between the laser, the plasma, and the magnetic field introduces additional layers of complexity. The novel solutions we present contribute to a deeper understanding of how radiation is emitted and interacts within magnetized plasmas, an essential aspect for advancing the development of next-generation laser-plasma accelerators. Our results underscore the limitations of conventional models and highlight the need for refined theoretical frameworks that can more accurately describe the intricate behaviors of particles and fields in these highly nonlinear environments.

Abstract: Hyperpolarized nuclear spins in molecules exhibit high magnetization that is unachievable by classical polarization techniques, making them widely used as sensors in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The state of a hyperpolarized material, however, is typically only studied indirectly and with partial destruction of magnetization, due to the nature of conventional detection by resonant-pickup nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or imaging. Here we establish atomic magnetometers with sub-pT sensitivity as an alternative modality to detect in real time the complex dynamics of hyperpolarized materials without disturbing or interrupting the magnetogenesis process. As an example of dynamics that are impossible to detect in real time by conventional means, we examine parahydrogen-induced $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C magnetization during adiabatic eigenbasis transformations at $\mu$T-field avoided crossings. Continuous but nondestructive magnetometry reveals previously unseen spin dynamics, fidelity limits, and magnetization backaction effects. As a second example, we apply magnetometry to observe the chemical-exchange-driven $^{13}$C hyperpolarization of [1--$^{13}$C]-pyruvate -- the most important spin tracer for clinical metabolic imaging. The approach can be readily combined with other high-sensitivity magnetometers and is applicable to a broader range of general observation scenarios involving production, transport and systems interaction of hyperpolarized compounds.

Abstract: Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. First, by exciting the sample with an intense THz pulse and probing the magnetization dynamics using magneto-optical Faraday effect, we find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via the THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects and paves the way towards novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.

Abstract: A universal numerical method is developed for the investigation of magnetic neutron scattering. By applying the pseudospectral-time-domain (PSTD) algorithm to the spinor version of the Schr\"odinger equation, the evolution of the spin-state of the scattered wave can be solved in full space and time. This extra spin degree of freedom brings some unique new features absent in the numerical theory on the scalar wave scatterings [1]. Different numerical stability condition has to be re-derived due to the coupling between the different spin states. As the simplest application, the neutron scattering by the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is studied. The PSTD predictions are compared with those from the Born-approximation. This work not only provides a systematic tool for analyzing spin-matter interactions, but also builds the forward model for testing novel neutron imaging methodologies, such as the newly developed thermal neutron Fourier-transform ghost imaging.

Abstract: Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting can emerge in the AB-stacking configurations. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP2S6, MnPX3 can show switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on its band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.

**Authors:** Seetharama, Jois

The development of metal-free magnetic resonance imaging agents demands precise control over molecular architecture to achieve optimal performance. Current fluorine-based contrast agents rely on maximizing fluorine content (> 20 wt%) for sensitivity, requiring extensive solubilizing groups that lead to signal-diminishing aggregation. Here we show that discrete brush polymers (Đ = 1.0) with precise backbone lengths and a single terminal fluorine group achieve superior imaging performance through architectural control rather than high fluorine content. This design prevents both intra- and intermolecular fluorine aggregation while maintaining high aqueous solubility, enabling sharper signals and higher sensitivity than conventional systems despite containing less than 7 wt% fluorine. Systematic investigation reveals how backbone length controls fluorine mobility and signal generation, establishing clear structure-property relationships previously obscured by molecular heterogeneity. This work demonstrates how precise architectural control can enhance functional performance beyond traditional approaches, providing new strategies for designing imaging materials.

# Enhancement of Photoluminescence Quantum Yield of Silver Clusters by Heavy Atom Effect

**Authors:** Thalappil, Pradeep

Many ligand-protected metal clusters exhibit phosphorescence at room temperature. However, strategies for improving their phosphorescence quantum yield, a critical parameter of performance, remain poorly developed. In contrast, fluorescent dyes are commonly modified by introducing heavy atoms, such as iodine (I), to enhance intersystem crossing in the excited state, thereby harnessing the heavy atom effect to increase phosphorescence efficiency. In this study, we successfully synthesized a pair of ligand-protected silver (Ag) clusters with internal cavities encapsulating anions (Xz−), namely sulfide ions (S2−) or iodide ions (I−), which significantly differ in atomic number each other. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the resulting Ag clusters were composed of X@Ag54S20(thiolate)20(sulfonate)m, where (X, m) = (S, 12) or (I, 11). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the Ag atoms in these compounds exhibit a mixed-valence state. Furthermore, experiments on their photoluminescence revealed that a heavy central anion induced an internal heavy-atom effect similar to that observed in organic fluorescent dyes. As a result, the phosphorescence quantum yield became 16 times higher when S2− was replaced by I− as the central atom.

Circularly polarized light can be utilized in numerous applications, including 3D displays and magnetic memory. In this study, pure-blue spin-polarized light-emitting diodes (spin-LEDs) were fabricated by depositing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) layers&amp;mdash;2D perovskites incorporating R/S-2-fluoromethylbenzylamine (R/S-2F-MBA) chiral cations&amp;mdash;on top of Br/Cl mixed-halide 3D perovskite thin films. The chiroptical properties of these heterostructured perovskites were significantly improved, as reflected in an approximately six-fold increase in circular dichroism over a conventional iodide perovskite. Density functional theory calculations indicated that as the ionic radius of the halogen atom decreased relative to that of iodine, the hydrogen bonding between the ammonium groups of the chiral cations and the halide anions in the inorganic slabs became stronger; this facilitated a chirality transfer from the 2F-MBA to the inorganic slabs and amplified the structural distortion. Halogen&amp;ndash;halogen interactions contributed further to this chirality transfer, improving the spin-polarizability of the CISS layer. The significantly enhanced CISS effect yielded pure-blue spin-LEDs with a circularly polarized electroluminescence dissymmetry factor exceeding 10%. Additionally, the highly polar R/S-2F-MBA chiral cations effectively passivated halide vacancies in the perovskite film, boosting luminescence as well as external quantum efficiency. As a preliminary proof of concept, the spin-LEDs were employed as vertical-type circularly polarized light photodetectors, enabling interactive optical wireless communication.
