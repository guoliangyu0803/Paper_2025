Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Density functional theory (DFT)-based methods provide a powerful mechanism for computing and probing the microscopic features of elastic tensor-related properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), for a comprehensive set of structural refractory body-centered cubic (BCC) binary alloys of molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), and tungsten (W). Intermediate quantities (force-response internal-strain tensor, $\Lambda$, and displacement-response internal-strain tensor, $\Gamma$) needed to compute the relaxed-ion elastic tensor are used here to map heterogeneity in elastic constants at each lattice site in a given alloy and associated relaxation fields. Derived polycrystalline aggregate properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), and Poisson's ratio ($\nu$) and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all binaries. Pugh's ratio ($B/G$) and the Cauchy pressure ($C'$) derived from computed elastic moduli are analyzed in order to evaluate the effect of alloying on the mechanical properties of the refractory BCC binary alloys. The computed mechanical properties data for the parent unary materials and binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. These results, together with computed microscopic field data, establish a foundation for the principled design of compositionally-complex, high-temperature-structural refractory alloys with desired elastic properties.

Abstract: Atomic migration from metallic contacts, and subsequent filament formation, is recognised as a prevailing mechanism leading to resistive switching in memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs). This study presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration of different metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs, employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-Equilibrium Green's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms, Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration both in the out-of-plane direction through a MoS\textsubscript{2} layer and along the surface of the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical and lateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually present in MoS\textsubscript{2} are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion of metal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristine MoS\textsubscript{2} and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the key elements that affect the switching performance of memristors. Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate the effects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance, providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.

# Hund's Rule, Interorbital Hybridization, and High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in the Bilayer Nickelate

Abstract: Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Using density matrix renormalization group for $T=0$ and thermal tensor networks for $T>0$ properties, along with density functional theory calculations, we investigate the intriguing interplay between the Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization that explains the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. By studying a two-orbital model, we identify three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\rm SC}$. In particular, the former always exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Below this temperature, the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\rm SC}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\rm SC}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances under pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure [J. Li, et al., arXiv:2404.11369 (2024)]. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Abstract: Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is of paramount importance for progress in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should be offering deep insights into these systems at the electronic level, but are limited in their efficacy by their steep computational cost. In this work, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably converge to the `gold standard' accuracy in quantum chemistry for application to extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multiscale resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms in size. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving a validating handshake between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a new benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references, and well inside the scatter of traditional density functional material modeling approaches. This pushes the state of the art for simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, and marks progress into a post-density functional era for more reliable and improvable approaches to first-principles modeling of surface problems at an unprecedented scale and accuracy using ab-initio quantum many-body methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with a finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-space approach for DFT calculations, combining the efficiency of PAW formalism involving smooth electronic fields with the ability of systematically improvable higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we have developed efficient strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of the FE basis overlap matrix in conjunction with reduced order quadrature rules to invert the discretized PAW overlap matrix while also exploiting the sparsity of both the local and non-local parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach, we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with plane-wave-based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a considerable computational advantage ($\sim$ 5$\times$ -- 10$\times$) over state-of-the-art plane-wave methods for medium to large-scale systems ($\sim$ 6,000 -- 35,000 electrons). Finally, we show that our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to achieve the desired accuracy, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations ($>$ 50,000 electrons) at an order of magnitude lower computational cost compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations using finite-element discretized calculations.

# Conical Intersections Studied by the Configuration-Interaction-Corrected Tamm-Dancoff Method

## 通过构型相互作用校正的tamm-dancoff方法研究的圆锥形相交

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-sv64m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Niranjan, Govind

Conical intersections directly mediate the internal energy conversion in photoinduced processes in a wide range of chemical and biological systems. Because of the Brillouin theorem, many conventional electronic structure methods, including configuration interaction with single excitations from a Hartree-Fock reference and time-dependent density functional theory in either the linear response approximation (TDDFT) or Tamm-Dancoff approximation (DFT-TDA), have the wrong dimensionality for conical intersections between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1) of the same multiplicity. This leads to unphysical state crossings. Here, we implement and assess the configuration-interaction-corrected Tamm-Dancoff approximation (CIC-TDA) that restores the correct dimensionality of conical intersections by including the coupling between the reference state and the intersecting excited state. We apply the CIC-TDA method to the S1/S0 conical intersections in ammonia (NH3), ethylene (C2H4), bithiophene (C8H6S2), azobenzene (C12H10N2), and 11-cis retinal protonated Schiff base (PSB11) in vacuo. We show that this black-box approach can produce potential energy surfaces (PESs) of comparable accuracy to multireference wave function methods. The method validated here can allow cost-efficient explorations of photoinduced electronically nonadiabatic dynamics, especially for large molecules and complex systems.
