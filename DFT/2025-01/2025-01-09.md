Abstract: Density functional theory has been applied to investigate structural and electronic properties of molybdenene monolayer in both its hexagonal and triclinic eigenstructures, within ultrasoft pseudopotential approach. In agreement with experimental findings, it has been found that either phase of molybdenene is metallic Dirac material, known as metallic relative of graphene. Partial density of state analysis has revealed that the $d$ valence orbitals of molybdenum atoms have had the largest contribution to such a metallic property, due to being half-empty and being the outermost. Phonon-dispersion calculations also have led to negative frequencies or soft modes for both eigenstructures, showing their instability in terms of lattice dynamics, as reported in experimental literature.

Abstract: We use density functional methods to identify the atomic configurations of H and D atoms trapped by O impurities and embedded in bulk Nb. We calculate the double-well potential for O-H and O-D impurities, wave functions, and tunnel splittings for H and D atoms. Our results are in agreement with those obtained from analysis of heat capacity and neutron scattering measurements on Nb with low concentrations of O-H and O-D.

Abstract: The Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect describes the ability of chiral molecules and crystals to transmit spin-polarized currents, a phenomenon first identified in 1999. Although this effect holds great promise for a broad spectrum of different applications in device physics and synthetic chemistry (including, e.g., spintronics, quantum computing, spin- and enantio-selective chemistry), its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The prevailing hypothesis attributes the CISS effect to enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within chiral molecules. However, the SOC magnitude required to align with experimental observations significantly exceeds the values derived from conventional atomic-scale calculations, particularly for systems composed of light atoms. In this work, we leverage the implementation of \texttt{fully relativistic density functional theory (DFT)} equations, as available in the \texttt{Dirac code}, to investigate how molecular chirality manifests itself in the chirality density of electronic states. We further explore how this responds to an applied external electric field. To assess spin-dependent transport, we employ the \texttt{Landauer-Imry-B\"uttiker} formalism, examining the dependence of spin transmission on the twist angle of the molecular structure that defines its geometrical chirality. While our findings qualitatively align with experimental trends, they point to the necessity of a more general treatment of SOC, \textit{e.g.}, including geometrical terms or through the dependence of advanced exchange-correlation functionals on the electronic spin-current density.

Abstract: In this short letter, I present a powerful application in dimensionality reduction of the lesser-used Jacobi-Davidson algorithm for the generalized eigenvalue decomposition. When combined with matrix-free implementations of relevant operators, this technique allows for the computation of the dynamics of an arbitrary quantum state to be done in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the original Hilbert space.

# Computational Insights into Hydrogen Interaction with the Ru (101 ̅1) and Ru (101 ̅0) Surfaces: Implications for Alkane and Polyolefin Hydrogenolysis

**Authors:** Sohaib, Umer

Hydrogen interaction with transition metal surfaces such as those exposed by ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles is critical in applications like hydrogen storage and catalytic processes such as Fischer-Tropsch, Haber-Bosch, and plastic waste hydrogenolysis. While the Ru (0001) surface is well-studied, hydrogen interaction with the Ru (101 ̅1) and Ru (101 ̅0) facets remains mostly underexplored. In this contribution, we use density functional theory calculations to investigate hydrogen adsorption and dissociation and provide insights into the adsorbed hydrogen role in catalytic polyolefin plastic hydrogenolysis. We start our investigation by exploring all the unique surface and subsurface sites for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation and identify hcp and higher hollow as the most favorable atomic hydrogens adsorption sites on the Ru (101 ̅1) and Ru (101 ̅0) surfaces, respectively. We find that atomic hydrogen can easily migrate on these surfaces to achieve the most stable arrangement at different coverages. We then combine these findings with ab-initio thermodynamics and microkinetic modeling to build surface phase diagrams, which show that both surfaces are fully hydrogenated under typical catalytic conditions. We then study how the presence of the full hydrogen coverage affects the adsorption and dehydrogenation of butane as a proxy for polyethylene, as these are the initial steps in the catalytic hydrogenolysis of polyolefin plastic waste. We find that the adsorption energy of butane decreases when the two surfaces are fully hydrogenated but adsorption remains favorable. We then investigate two possible mechanisms for the dehydrogenation step. The most favorable dehydrogenation mechanism involves the reaction of a surface hydrogen with an alkane hydrogen to produce H2 gas and an adsorbed alkyl radical. However, both mechanisms have positive reaction free energies suggesting that polyolefin dehydrogenation will be slow on these surfaces.

# Formation and Reactivity of Silicon Oxyhydrides in Nickel Hydrogenation Catalysts Supported on Silica

## 负载在二氧化硅上的镍加氢催化剂中羟基硅的形成和反应性

Silica is generally regarded as an inert support in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, including hydrogenation-dehydrogenation catalysis, on which hydrogen spillover is debated. Since supported hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts are generally activated in H2 as reducing gas at medium-high temperatures (350–500 °C), we suspected that hydride formation could occur during such catalyst pretreatments. In this work, we investigated silicon oxyhydride (SiHxOy, SiHx for brevity) formation during the reduction pretreatment of a set of Ni/SiO2 catalyst materials using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). We observed two distinct vibrational bands located at ~ 2275 and ~ 2257 cm−1, which we assigned to SiH and SiH2 species, as supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Since these vibrational bands are absent after hydrogenation of pure silica, we propose that the formation of hydrides was caused by hydrogen spillover from Ni metal nanoparticles supported on silica. The decrease in the band areas with rising temperature was used in a van t ‘Hoff plot to yield enthalpy values of ~ 26 and ~ 42 kJ/mol for the apparent reaction of hydride species, suggesting an equilibrium with IR-inactive or very mobile species. The reactivity of the SiHx species was also investigated, by dosing methanol, water and CO2 as probe molecules on the pre-reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Methanol reacted the fastest with the hydride species, followed by water, while CO2 did not show any interaction with the hydrides. We anticipate this work will contribute to changing the view of silica as an inert support material, and to the understanding of H spillover in more general.

# Quantum Dynamics Simulations of the Polariton Transport

## 极化子输运的量子动力学模拟

**Authors:** Wenxiang, Ying

Recent experiments have shown that exciton transport can be significantly enhanced through hybridization with confined photonic modes in a cavity. The light-matter hybridization generates exciton-polaritons bands, whose group velocity is significantly larger than the excitons. Dissipative mechanisms that affect the constituent states of EPs, such as exciton-phonon coupling and cavity loss, have been observed to reduce the group velocities in experiments. To elucidate the impacts of these dissipative mechanisms on polariton transport, we develop an efficient quantum dynamics approach that allows us to directly simulate polariton transport under the collective coupling regime and beyond long-wavelength approximation. Our numerical results suggest a renormalization of the group velocities with stronger exciton-phonon coupling strengths and a smaller Q-factor. We observe the transition from ballistic to diffusive propagation, as well as the quality factor-dependent behavior of the transient mean square displacement, agreeing well with the recent experimental measurements.
