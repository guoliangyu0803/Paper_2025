Identifying and characterizing intermolecular forces in the condensed phase is crucial for understanding both micro- and macroscopic properties of solids; ranging from solid-state reactivity to thermal expansion. Insight into these interactions enables a holistic comprehension of bulk properties, and thus understanding them has direct implications for supramolecular design. However, even modest changes to intermolecular interactions can create unpredictable changes to solid-state structures and dynamics. For example, copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(C5}H7O2)2) and copper(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate (Cu(C5HF6O2)2) exhibit similar molecular conformations, yet differences between the methyl and trifluoromethyl groups produce distinct sets of intermolecular forces in the condensed phase. Ultimately, these differences produce unique molecular arrangements in the solid state, with corresponding differences in material properties between the two crystals. In this work, terahertz spectroscopy is used to measure low-frequency vibrational dynamics, which, by extension, provide detailed insight into the underlying intermolecular forces that exist in each system. The experimental data is coupled to theoretical quantum mechanical simulations to precisely quantify the interplay between various energetic effects, and these results highlight the delicate balance that is struck between electronic and dispersive interactions that underpin the structural and related differences between the two systems.

# Understanding the origin of the extended stability window in water-in-salt electrolytes

Water-in-salt electrolytes (WISEs) offer extended voltage stability, enabling the use of high-voltage materials in aqueous energy storage systems. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed in some WISEs plays a key role in enabling this enhanced stability by passivating the electrode surface. However, non-SEI-forming WISEs also exhibit similar stability window, despite the lack of an SEI, though the mechanism behind remains insufficiently understood.  In this work, we investigate the origins of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) suppression across a range of electrolyte concentrations of the non-SEI-forming electrolytes: from dilute solutions to WISE, using electrochemical techniques, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We disentangle the contributions of water activity, local pH changes induced by HER in non-buffering neutral electrolytes, and kinetic and mass transport effects. We establish a correlation between HER activity and active surface coverage by water molecules: in WISEs sluggish HER kinetics is observed, as indicated by a sevenfold decrease in exchange current density. Additionally, we reveal that in WISE HER is significantly limited by the sluggish water transport in the double layer, further contributing to the extended experimental voltage stability window.

Although chiral substituents have been incorporated into ansa chains to stabilize the conformations of cyclophanes and modulate the biological activities of pharmaceuticals, the asymmetric syntheses of these atropisomers relies on substrate-induced diastereoselective macrocyclization. Consequently, enantio-, atrop-, and diastereoselective macrocyclizations are yet to be reported. Herein, we describe a N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) dual-catalytic process for the desymmetrization of 1,3-diols, to achieve macrocyclization and stereoselective control over two chiral elements. It was deduced that the hydrogen bonding of CPA with the 1,3-diols enhanced the diastereoselectivity of the process. As a result, various planar-chiral cyclophanes bearing chiral ansa chains were synthesized. Thermodynamic experiments revealed that the presence of an all-carbon quaternary carbon center on the ansa chain significantly increased the rotational barriers of the cyclophanes. Moreover, density functional theory calculations suggested that the chiral substituent shrinks the ansa chain by compressing the bond angle, thereby rendering the conformational rotation reaction more challenging.
